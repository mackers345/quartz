This digital garden is a way for me to record and share information for future civil engineers, and act as a way to document my learning\n\n![Engineering Forest](attachments/image/_index-1655218700129.jpeg)\n\n## Get Started\n### How it started\nI first started the practice of better note-taking when I became interested in the [[Second Brain]] movement, brought to my attention by [[Ali Abdaal]] and [[Tiago Forte]]. I wanted a way to record and link my experience and knowledge as I started working towards my [[notes/Professional Review MOC]]. Over time this has grown to become a vital part of my [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system, and now I am wanting to expand this so others can use it too. I will treat this as a [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening/), tending and growing notes as I gain more knowledge.\n\n### How it works\nThis website contains a number of different pages, including methodologies, definitions, examples and reflections on civil engineering practice, some book summaries and other materials. \nTo navigate around the site, simply click on something that looks interesting or use the search tool at the top to find something specific. \nCertain bigger topics will have a [Map of Content (MOC)](notes/Map%20of%20Content%20(MOC).md) which acts as a homepage of sorts to help direct you to useful information.

These are:\n\n- Offer - goods, services, product or money must be offered. \n- Acceptance - a party mu st provide verbal or written acceptance.\n- Monetary Value - an exchange must be present to accept the offer.\n\nThere are a few different easy definitions of contracts, one is \"the rules of the game\", and another is \"the allocation of [[risk]]\". The choice of which contract is applied to certain work packages entirely depends on the level of risk to be taken on by the Client and the Contractor. This can dictate whether a [[notes/Civil Engineering MOC/Commercial MOC/Priced Contract]] or [[Target Cost]] is applied.\n\nThe [[NEC3]] contract, with which I have had the most experience, is broken down into the following key sections:\n\n - [[Core Clauses]] \n - Option Clauses ([[Option A Activity Schedule]], [[Option B Bill of Quantities]] etc.)\n - [[W Clauses]] - dispute resolution\n - [[X Clauses]] - ways to implement the recovery and provision of money\n - [[Z Clauses]] - deviations and adjustments to the standard form of contract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation: [Homepage](_index.md), [Civil Engineering MOC](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC.md), [Areas MOC](Areas%20MOC)\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-16T06:15:21.481497713Z","tags":null},"/notes/Civil-Engineering-MOC/Commercial-MOC/Priced-Contract":{"title":"Priced Contract","content":"# Priced Contract\nPriced contracts are where a lump sum of work is allocated for a project, and money is released under different conditions. This generally places more risk on the contractor carrying out the work, as if the works are more expensive than estimated, the contractor must bear that cost. Conversely however, savings can also benefit the contractor.\n\n**[[Option A Activity Schedule]]** - This is a form of contract where money is released based on activities being completed. I tend to remember this by thinking that this contract type is more suitable for activities where the exact quantity is hard to define. For example, this contract type is more applicable to a package such as Vegetation Clearance; an activity might be to clear a section of site. The contractor can create this Activity Schedule and agree it with the client. If this was an Option B contract, it would require the individual number of trees to be defined and costed accordingly, which would become unfeasible. The lump sum agreed is open to change through the use of [[Compensation Event (CE)]]s if additional activities are required.\n\nThe advantage of an [[Option A Activity Schedule]] for a Client is that it improves cost certainty and transfers this [[risk]] to the contractor. Contrary to an [[Option B Bill of Quantities]] contract, where the contractor can start work and charge for the materials used by remeasuring, the Client knows upfront what each activity is going to cost and it is down to the Contractor to ensure the activities are completed under budget to make profit. There is almost zero-risk for the client in a case like this.\n\n**[[Option B Bill of Quantities]]** - Contrary to Option A, the work is priced in physical units, set out in a Bill of Quantities. An applicable works package for use with this contract may be a bored piling contractor, where the exact number of piles is known from the start and therefore the materials required to complete the work can be derived. It may set out the quantity of concrete for a pile pour, the hire of the plant needed, the cost of steelwork, and everything else related to the work. One benefit this has over the Option A contract is that money can be released as material are used and a proportion of work is completed, contrary to Option A where money is released only when an activity has been fully completed.\n\nIn the [[Allocation of Risk]] debate, the [[Option B Bill of Quantities]] contract transfers much more risk towards the Client. The costs are much harder to control and predict. To incorporate a level of certainty for the Client, the contract can contain a set of [[Disallowed Costs]]. These generally include [[Preliminaries]], which include costs for labour, staff, overheads, site security and everything that facilitates the completion of the work. It does not include the actual cost of materials. This incentivises the Contractor to complete the project to the key dates set out by the Client.\n\nWithout certain measures, a Contractor could start work and remeasure heavily in their favour. There would be little recourse if the \n\nThere is a distinct difference between Option A and B in that in Option A, payment is only issued when an activity is \"fully completed\". In other contracts, there can be the issue of payment under certain circumstances for \"partial\" or \"substantial\" completion, however this is not the case under [[NEC3]]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation: [Homepage](_index.md), [Civil Engineering MOC](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC.md), [Areas MOC](Areas%20MOC)\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-16T06:15:21.481497713Z","tags":null},"/notes/Civil-Engineering-MOC/Design-MOC/Design-MOC":{"title":"Design MOC","content":"![Design Work](attachments/image/Design%20MOC-1655304589437.jpeg)\n# Design MOC\nI started completing civil engineering design work as part of a [[Temporary Works]] design team.

Understanding and Practical Application of Engineering","content":"# 1. Understanding and Practical Application of Engineering\nThis Attribute is subdivided into 8 parts if you are aiming for Chartered Engineer level.\n\n\u003e A) Maintain and extend knowledge of engineering theory and practice, and how technology assists its application\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Solve engineering problems using a sound theoretical approach, based on evidence, and contribute to continuous improvement\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Engage in the creation and/or introduction of new, advancing or improved techniques and technology\n\u003e \n\u003e D) Identify, review and select techniques, procedures and methods to undertake engineering tasks\n\u003e \n\u003e E) Take an active role in the identification and definition of requirements, challenges, risks, and opportunities and undertake appropriate investigation and action\n\u003e \n\u003e F) Contribute to the design and development of engineering solutions, implement those solutions, and evaluate their effectiveness in the context of the whole project life cycle\n\u003e \n\u003e G) Undertake the design, development and implementation of engineering solutions and evaluate their effectiveness in the context of the whole project life cycle\n\u003e \n\u003e H) Exercise sound independent engineering judgement\n\nFor IEng level you need to satisfy A), B), D), F), and H), while for CEng level you need to satisfy all eight. But what is the difference between them?\n\nThe A) and B) are about getting your knowledge up to the current industry best practices, while C) and D) are about taking it further. Of course as a CEng applicant you will need to know what the current best practices are before you attempt anything new. Similar to how you would perform a literature review in an academic thesis in the first chapter.\n\nThere is not an expectation to create something totally new, but more appropriately a small amendment in how things were previously done which brings improvement for the industry or the society. For instance:\n\n-   Did you amend a concrete pouring sequence to save 2% of total concrete volume, or speed up the process by 3%?\n-   Did you manage to automate via a computer script a boring but important engineering job to save time for everyone and free up resources?\n-   Did you do a bit of research behind a building design code and notice some leeway to deviate under certain situations?\n\nIf you studied for a Masters or Doctorate degree then satisfying this Attribute should be fairly straightforward, as the requirements to pass those degrees are in line with what is required here.\n\nRemember you need to show capability to do the above, so think broadly, even if your evidences are not so relevant to your daily work. For instance, you can demonstrate your eagerness to learn through attending all sorts of courses and conferences, and for CEng – applying this newly gained knowledge in your role. You may have helped a friend to design an extension to his house and had to do background research. (Though this last example on its own probably would not get you through a review.)\n\nJust remember the main things to you will need to demonstrate in your portfolio and review are:\n\n-   Curiosity and self-initiative\n-   Ability to learn by yourself\n-   Why your new, and old, knowledge is beneficial to engineering\n-   How you are able to introduce your new idea/technique into industry. (Or at least a good understanding of where the difficulties may lie in the process and what you could potentially do about them)\n\n👉 Next: [2.

Management and Leadership","content":"# 2. Management and Leadership\nWhat does this mean exactly? If you read the text carefully from the first attribute, you will notice that half of the sub-attributes relate to whether you are driving the industry forward with your engineering research or application. A similar concept applies to this Attribute but in the context of management processes.\n\nThis Attribute is divided as follows\n\n\u003e A) Plan the work and resources needed to enable effective implementation of engineering tasks and projects\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Manage the planning and organisation of tasks and resources.\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Manage (organise, direct and control), programme or schedule, tasks and resources\n\u003e \n\u003e D) Manage teams or technical specialisms\n\u003e \n\u003e E) Lead or influence teams / technical specialisms, understanding the limits of their skills and knowledge\n\u003e \n\u003e F) Assist others to meet changing technical and managerial needs\n\u003e \n\u003e G) Develop others to meet changing technical and managerial needs\n\u003e \n\u003e H) Manage quality processes and contribute to quality improvements\n\u003e \n\u003e I) Demonstrate continuous quality improvement and promote best practice\n\nParts A), B), D), F), and H) are a requirement for IEng whilst CEng requires all nine attributes to be satisfied. The difference being that CEng requires you to demonstrate you can lead by example and evaluate processes for continual improvement; whilst IEng is simply management of the status quo.\n\n\u003e Lessons Learnt – always a powerful tool of evaluation and continuous improvement [Source](https://pixabay.com/en/photos/checklist/)\n\nThe key to achieving this attribute is to avoid succumbing to complacency. If any process, no matter how small or big, goes well it is easy to pat each other's back and call it a job well done. But you should always record some form of after action review, whether formally or privately, and ask yourself the following questions:\n\n-   What went well?\n-   What went not so well?\n-   Was it to programme?\n-   Was it to budget?\n-   Was it to satisfactory quality?\n-   Was it sustainable?\n-   What were the bottlenecks in the processes?\n-   How did I manage any difficulties I came across?\n-   Is it possible to get feedback from others I worked with?\n-   What could I do differently next time with knowledge I gained from this experience?\n\n\nOn the topic of technical and managerial needs, you are required to show how you identified opportunities to improve your colleagues' abilities in new technologies or skills. For instance, you may have:\n\n-   Delivered seminars on the latest revisions to design codes or regulations, e.g. CDM 2015 or EN/ISO design code revisions\n-   Making adjustments to a document control or other registry tool and assisting staff with its implementation\n-   Created a computer script to automate labour-intensive tasks and gotten people to use it.\n-   Led H\u0026S inspections and implementation on site\n-   Identified commercial issues and developing a process to mitigate them  \n    Influencing teams the benefits of BIM; tweaking existing processes to suit BIM and implementing training and workshops in relation to rollout of BIM\n\nThe good thing about this Attribute is that you should be able to show Chartership qualities in your working behaviour from day one, even if it takes some further time to collect your evidence. With the right mentality of always striving to improve everything, if you can keep demonstrating your application of learnings then you should be able to satisfy this attribute very quickly.\n\n👉 Next: [3.

Commercial Ability","content":"# 3. Commercial Ability\nDuring the 2013 ICE Review sessions, Commercial Ability was the most divided failure point, with 70% of Hong Kong applicants failing on this Attribute alone. Compare this to 53% of UK applicants and 47% of those from the Rest of the World (Source: SCE Newsletter February 2014).\n\nFor ICE Trainees in large companies this Attribute can sometimes be tricky to satisfy especially if you are working in a position which does not easily permit you to manage commercial aspects of projects or business.\n\nHere are the Sub-Attributes for this section:\n\n\u003e A) Manage, prepare and control costs/budgets of engineering tasks or projects\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Manage, prepare and control costs/budgets of a significant engineering task or project\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Use sound knowledge of statutory and commercial frameworks within their own area of responsibility and have an appreciation of other commercial arrangements\n\u003e \n\u003e D) Demonstrate sound judgement on statutory, contractual and commercial issues in relation to own area of responsibility\n\nPart A) by itself is actually a requirement for Incorporated Engineer level, so this should indicate that a Chartered Engineer will need to be pretty strong in financial capabilities. This does not necessarily mean you need to be as good as a qualified accountant!\n\nSince almost every engineer should (in theory) be good at mathematics, the process of learning the calculations behind budgets should not pose as a difficult challenge in itself – but just acquiring the exposure to commercial activities and tasks.\n\nIt is wise to learn your company's business processes; your project's legal and contractual framework and related terms and conditions; in addition to gaining awareness of your company's financial systems used.  As a minimum, you should know the answers to ALL of the following:\n\n-   In which jurisdiction(s) do your contracts apply?\n-   What are the terms and conditions in the contract?\n-   How are the contracts formed? (e.g. competitive bidding? What stipulations are required?)\n-   Who are the responsible parties in your contracts, and what are their duties?\n-   What are the consequences of non-compliance to the contract?\n-   What variations (including breakouts) are permissible in your contracts, or how can parties agree to them?\n-   What are the remedial actions permitted or stated in your contract (if any)?\n-   What are the mechanisms/processes in your business that need to be done to arrange payment to an external party?\n\n\nCan you define the term “[[Contract]]”? What is your exposure to the various types? [Source](http://www.thebluediamondgallery.com/highlighted/c/contract.html)\n\nTo demonstrate “sound judgement”, your reviewers may test your ability by asking you to discuss in significant detail the strengths and weaknesses of the contracts you deal with, or any improvements you would suggest for next time.\n\nOn business processes, perhaps if a particular item parameter were modified somewhere in the process, would you have a good idea of the potential consequences to the rest of the process? What amendments would be required in order to enable that modification to take place, or if it is impossible, what would the next best option be and what would its disadvantage be compared to the original method?\n\nIf you have evidence of playing an influential part in the commercial aspects of your work then this is of course the best way to demonstrate your competence. Otherwise, you may have to draw on any other experiences such as running societies or charitable organisations outside work – but alone this will not be enough to satisfy the Reviewers.\n\nNevertheless, the best commercial experiences can be gained from placements within the estimating and commercial departments – or at least performing tasks and activities on behalf of those in those departments. Such tasks could include monitoring labour, plant, materials and equipment used for activities on site; and using that data for calculating costs on behalf of the Quantity Surveyor. Alternatively, that data could be extrapolated for benchmarking, pricing and estimating similar projects in the future.\n\n👉 Next: [4.

Health Safety and Welfare","content":"# 4. Health Safety and Welfare\nHealth and Safety is a serious and important topic in the construction industry. It is expected for every person who travels to work on a construction site, is able to safely return home after finishing work each day. Falls from height are among the biggest causes of fatalities and lost time injuries.\n\nConstruction industry trainees vying to qualify with any professional body must show understanding of the hazards and risks in the workplace, but also do the utmost of their ability to eliminate, reduce, inform or control them. In addition, ICE Trainees should be able to facilitate the improvement of Health, Safety \u0026 Welfare (H\u0026SW) on construction sites – whether that is during the design stage or whilst during the construction phase.\n\nThe sub-Attributes are:\n\n\u003e A) Demonstrate a sound knowledge of legislation, hazards and safe systems of work\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Manage risks\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Manage health, safety and welfare within their own area of responsibility\n\u003e \n\u003e D) Contribute to improvements in health, safety and welfare\n\u003e \n\u003e E) Demonstrate leadership by promoting good practice and improvements in health, safety and welfare\n\nParts A) – D) are a requirement for IEng, with E) the extra requirement for CEng.\n\nWhile health and safety is often discussed at work, relatively little attention is given to welfare. A working environment may be seen as safe, but how do the workers feel about their conditions there? How might someone working on an offshore oil platform feel about spending 4 weeks at a time away from family with the facilities around him/her?\n\nMental Health is often overlooked in the workplace [Source](https://pixabay.com/en/mental-health-wellness-psychology-2019924/)\n\nMental health, stress and work/life balance is also a growing issue around the world and should be contemplated by ICE Trainees.\n\nThe likelihood is that your reviewers will monitor this Attribute very strictly because of how easy it is to become complacent, and the potentially fatal consequences of complacency.\n\nCandidates should be able to demonstrate a strong working knowledge of the following:\n\n-   The applicable laws regarding Health, Safety and Welfare (HS\u0026W) in the countries where your projects are based. (See also our blog post on [whether CDM applies offshore.](http://thestructuralexam.com/2016/08/13/cdm-regulations-apply-offshore/))\n-   Company policies on HS\u0026W and where it might differ (for better or for worse) to local practice.\n-   Industry trends relating to HS\u0026W in your discipline. (For instance, the risks related to offshore oil and gas may differ to onshore timber construction).\n-   Recent incidents, statistics and case studies of H\u0026SW in your country\n-   Implementation of H\u0026SW in your work (whether that is in design, implementation or managing)\n-   New technologies involving H\u0026SW\n\n\nThe best candidates will be able to gain knowledge on how H\u0026SW has evolved over the years to its current state of legislation and current practice, and how the trends may continue.\n\nFor many recent graduates who have embarked on their career in Civil Engineering, their CPD records will probably show a large amount of HS\u0026W training at the start of their IPD, but the subsequent years may show minimal participation or application of that knowledge gained (those particularly guilty of this are office-based consultants and clients). This implicitly violates sub-Attribute E) and continual maintenance on your CPD for HS\u0026W items should be seen as the bare minimum.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to show leadership in HS\u0026W, ranging from conducting risk assessments; writing method statements; organising and chairing H\u0026SW forums and rewriting your company’s safety procedures (to name a few…).

Sustainable Development\nWhile there are now people making whole careers as environmental specialists, your job as a Chartered Civil Engineer will require very intricate involvement with sustainability studies, as described by these sub-parts.\n\n\u003e A) Understand the principles of sustainable development and apply them in work\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Manage engineering activities that contribute to sustainable development and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs)\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Take a professional and responsible role in improvements that support sustainable development and reduce resource demand, set in the context of a whole project life cycle\n\nObviously, if you are taking the lead (or at least judged to be capable of it) then you will probably need to have a sound knowledge and be capable of managing some activities relating to sustainable development. Therefore try to focus on C) only.\n\nAll ICE Trainees must be able to define [[Sustainability]].\n\nAs identified by the 2005 World Summit on Sustainable Development, it is typically known that there are the ‘Three Pillars of Sustainability'. They are:\n\n-   Social\n-   Economical\n-   Environmental\n\n![Sustainable](https://i0.wp.com/thecivilengineeringexam.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sustainabile-1024x653.png?resize=620%2C395)\n\nThe Three Pillars of Sustainability [Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sustainable_development.svg)\n\nThe hot topic of any major civil or structural engineering project in the 21st century is environmental impact. How construction and manufacturing is conducted in the future is now under greater scrutiny since the recent Paris Summit in December 2015. Therefore, to stand a good chance of passing your Review, you should try to demonstrate leadership in the “Environmental” and one of Economical and Social, with at least working knowledge of the last.\n\nIn many cases it should be fairly obvious whether you are doing a piece of work related to sustainability, such as:\n\nWhat have you done to demonstrate that you are working on a sustainable project? [Source](https://pixabay.com/en/co2-global-warming-global-warming-1076817/)\n\n- CO2 emissions reductions calculations for your project.\n- Disposal of products (e.g. facility decommissioning, toxic handling etc.)\n- Waste management in accordance to legislation\n- Improvement of industry standards / technical developments\n- Compliance with changes in legislation\n- Lifetime extensions of buildings/infrastructure\n- Societal impacts caused by your project.\n\nThis Attribute is probably a little less demanding than the others in terms of content and ability. For most people you might not be making the environmental decisions, which is expected. It will just be a case of demonstrating your participation in engineering, and what sustainable benefits your decisions influenced.\n\n👉 Next: [6.

Of all the Attributes you will be reviewed against, this is probably the easiest to fulfil and the one that has strongest transferability should you wish to consider a career change.\n\n\u003e A) Communicate well with others at all levels including effective use of English*, orally and in writing*\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Discuss ideas and plans competently and with confidence\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Communicate new concepts and ideas to technical and non-technical stakeholders\n\u003e \n\u003e D) Demonstrate effective personal and social skills\n\u003e \n\u003e E) Demonstrate awareness of diversity and inclusion\n\u003e \n\u003e F) Proactively manage diversity and inclusion\n\u003e \n\u003e *Subject to the Welsh Language Act.\n\nParts A), B, D), and E) are marked as Incorporated Engineer level, while candidates seeking chartered engineer status need to satisfy all 6 sub-attributes.\n\nThe odd one out in the above sub-Attributes, but definitely not any less worthy, is F), managing diversity issues. This is a recent addition to ICE's criteria but is very important to 21st Century professionalism, as you need to demonstrate that you can work with people of any race, religion, sex, disability, sexual orientation etc. and also to improve inclusiveness in your workplace. A good starting point is [this interview](http://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/careers/diversity-in-engineering/)of Bola Fatimilehin, Head of Diversity at the Royal Academy of Engineering, published in Black History Month 365.\n\nNearly all Professional Reviews will be conducted in English, though there is an archaic law which allows you to take your exam in Welsh instead. From what most reviewers have told us, most candidates in Wales sit their reviews in English.\n\nOn the communications side, you need to be able to be explain, discuss, argue, present all sorts of details to all sorts of audience. You might find you need to describe how glass-reinforced polymers have anisotropic material properties to a group of 10 year old school children with no material science knowledge, or you might one day be delivering a proposal to Parliament and defending yourself against angry protestors on why putting a high speed train line through pristine countryside makes economical, environmental and technical sense.\n\nYou should not worry too much about satisfying the communications aspects of this Attribute if your English is totally fluent. This Attribute is only ever a considerable barrier for those using the European Directive or Mutual Recognition routes and hardly use English in their daily lives. If this is the case, you should seek to continually practise your written and spoken English well ahead of your Review.\n\n👉 Next: [7.

For instance, one that ALL Professional Review candidates should watch, regardless of the grade you are applying for, is the [James Rennie Medal](https://www.ice.org.uk/careers-and-professional-development/careers-advice-for-civil-engineers/professional-review-awards) which is awarded to the best CEng MICE candidate from the previous year.  TCEE also has some interesting CPD videos that can count towards CPD in the future.\n\n![TCEE CPD Cycle](https://i0.wp.com/thecivilengineeringexam.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TCEE-CPD-3-1024x761.png?resize=620%2C461)\n\nThe CPD Cycle\n\nAt the time of your Professional Review you will need to submit your CPD records, but rather than seeing this as a burden, it is remarkably easy to maintain if you spend just 15 minutes per week or fortnight. Our recommendation is to do it at the same time as you do your timesheets (if you have such a system) as you will need to look back at what you have done for the previous period anyway. It therefore takes little additional effort to get it done. There is a template [.DOCX](https://www.ice.org.uk/my-ice/membership-documents/continuing-professional-development-guidance) file available for use, though the ICE is encouraging everyone to do it online these days.\n\nWith regards to “demonstrating appropriate professional standards”, well if you can behave yourself that's a good start. You need to show you are committed, passionate and excited about the industry and profession. How can you do this? You can demonstrate this at your interview with good knowledge and opinion on latest developments in particular sectors of civil engineering, policies or environmental concerns. The list is very open ended but this provides a fantastic opportunity to prove yourself to be a good commentator in a chosen sector.\n\nStatistically speaking this Attribute is least likely to cause failure, so you can distribute your focus and efforts to other Attributes as you see appropriate.\n\n👈 Previous: [6.

So here is an ICE Communication Task example to give an idea of what a good passing standard looks like.\n\nAfterwards, [Tim Lai](https://thecivilengineeringexam.com/introduction/about-us/) will give his reflections on writing this essay, the key aspects you should try to reproduce in your own attempts and also what he could have done better.\n\n\u003e # **There is a perception in some quarters that oil exploration and production harms the environment. Discuss how civil engineers can play a key role in mitigating the impact and altering this perception.**\n\u003e \n\u003e _by Tim Lai, February 2016_\n\u003e \n\u003e # **Introduction**\n\u003e \n\u003e In April 2010 the world’s spotlight was shone onto the largest manmade environmental disaster to have ever occurred in the world. In the middle of the night, The Deepwater Horizon drill ship was performing routine exploration work on the Macondo Prospect and a surge in subsurface pressure caused a massive explosion on the ship, which caused millions of barrels of oil to flow into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\u003e \n\u003e For nearly three months the general public were bombarded with extremely distressing pictures of sea life covered in thick crude oil and a large proportion of Southern USA had its pristine shoreline irreversibly damaged by a manmade event.\n\u003e \n\u003e A few years later the Federal Bureau of Safety for the US declared that none of the contributing events were caused by civil engineers. Yet in the oil industry, every person regardless of skill is judged by its weakest performer.\n\u003e \n\u003e In the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) Code of Conduct, there is the explicit requirement of Rule 4 that all members “show due regard for the environment and for the sustainable management of natural resources”. From my experience working at the forefront of academic research in pipeline integrity and as a structural engineer for one of the world’s largest Petrochemical Operators, this essay discusses how I feel civil engineers can take the industry forward in two particular ways. Firstly about mitigating the impact of the negative perception about harm to the environment. Secondly it addresses some steps towards altering and thus improving the perception from here forth.\n\u003e \n\u003e # **Mitigation of impact**\n\u003e \n\u003e The UN Summit of Stockholm in 1972 on Human Environment set 26 Principles that mankind should adhere to in order to create an environmentally sustainable planet. Its chairperson, Harlem Brundtland is attributed to coining a key guideline for all persons of every walk of life to follow:\n\u003e \n\u003e “Sustainability development meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”\n\u003e \n\u003e The 26 Principles from the Declaration of the Conference are broadly set out in 5 themes:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1.  The requirements for a dignified human existence and the comfort levels associated with it.\n\u003e 2.  The global economy should facilitate progress towards a better environment\n\u003e 3.  Environmental considerations should play an integral part of development planning\n\u003e 4.  Forming and allowing the right people and organisations to perform research towards sustainable development and then keeping the public educated\n\u003e 5.  Each signatory country’s obligations to its neighbours and the necessity of co-operation.\n\u003e \n\u003e Since the Stockholm Conference, there have been further high-profile gatherings at Rio de Janeiro, Berlin, Kyoto, Doha and Paris which set further specific measures and targets (and in some cases legally-binding) for signatory parties to cut their emissions.\n\u003e \n\u003e With the correct framework and cooperation with governments ranging from local all the way to international scale, civil engineers can and have a duty to play a crucial part in all of the above themes.\n\u003e \n\u003e Civil engineers must provide expert opinion and analysis to policy makers on the effect of major infrastructural projects – often no more controversial than those in the oil sector. Indeed if a body which represents a petroleum industry could be visibly led by a civil engineer, then we may see decisions not purely driven by money at the (perceived) detriment to the environment. We have to look no further than that National Infrastructure Commission as recently formed in the UK which has as one of their commissioners none other than the current President of the ICE to provide a leading steer.\n\u003e \n\u003e Expert analysis from civil engineers can produce key performance indicators for projects such as embodied CO2 or predicted Greenhouse Gas emissions, but the real skill is to generate engineering solutions which create a sustainable balance from the initiation to completion of the project. The sustainability can lie in any of the three pillars of environmental, social and economical, but any intended bias towards one of the three pillars can be closely communicated with policy and decision makers.\n\u003e \n\u003e In the Netherlands one of the most recent and significant offshore gas field discoveries in the mid-1980s showed that the calorific content of the gas was significantly higher than those from previously discovered fields. This created a dilemma for the Dutch Government and engineers at the time. How should the energy infrastructure of the country be managed to meet this new enormous reserve, or vice versa?\n\u003e \n\u003e In balancing the three pillars of sustainability and to help manage the cashflow of the sovereign wealth, civil engineers would have needed to cooperate with petroleum engineers and policy makers needed to have analyse multiple conflicting parameters. What solution generates the lowest gas usage overall? How much more gas is there in the existing reserves? How certain are we of these estimates? How much would it cost to re-fit boilers in every house of the country? How would the answers to all these questions change if the oil or gas price changed significantly?\n\u003e \n\u003e Ultimately, if civil engineers are not in the position of being decision makers for a government, then it is his/her remit to inform, give impartial advice and present a range of suitable solutions with their positive or negative effects . If the civil engineer is in the situation of being a decision maker (such as the National Infrastructure Commission), then in addition to the above duties, there is another equally important job – public engagement and communication.\n\u003e \n\u003e # **Altering Public Perception**\n\u003e \n\u003e Extremely tough decisions and sacrifices on multi-billion dollar projects have to be taken once in a while, and the modern trend in communication is that the public media effectively drives a politician’s re-election. It has a potential to create a conflict of interest such that the politician may be driven by the need to spin sound-bites and media attention, compared to what may be holistically ‘best’ for a  controversial project such as the development of an oil prospect.\n\u003e \n\u003e Such large scale oil projects has many stages each taking many years. It is fairly common for the timespan from exploration to first oil to last one or two decades. These phases, along with a civil engineer’s career, is likely to span multiple administrations of governments where they will no doubt have schizophrenically differing agendas and priorities. There is therefore an unintended moral and professional duty to uphold the decisions of their employer, enterprise and governments of the day even if they are conflicting in intent. It should therefore seem sensible that civil engineers must form an integral part of making those decisions and disseminate the information to the wider public to promote healthy two-way feedback.\n\u003e \n\u003e Where engineers commonly fall short is their ability to communicate complex technical ideas to non-technical audiences. Despite communication being a highly valued skill and necessary in nearly every engineering body in the world, the public figureheads of civil engineering (and perhaps engineering in general) are still often seen to be monotonous, intelligent but incommunicable and emotionally stimulated by things which are not necessarily fashionable in the status quo.\n\u003e \n\u003e Oil projects, whose inherent environmental controversy generates news headlines around the world, will for the foreseeable future be subject to many heated arguments and endless scrutiny. Where human emotions start to interfere with the debate, all the required logic and constructive feedback is often rendered futile. Perhaps being naturally risk averse, civil engineers should undertake further training in hostile public encounters to ameliorate such scenarios.\n\u003e \n\u003e Where emotions are driven by mass media, engineers should be able to act as an impartial focal point between journalists and enterprises. This could take the shape of Non-Government Organisations or other legal/charitable entities but the engineer must be free to speak his/her mind without fear of repercussions. Much like how an expert witness is summoned by Court.\n\u003e \n\u003e In recent times ‘sustainability’ and ‘environmentally friendly’ have been used by the public interchangeably and synonymously. As hinted at earlier by the three pillars analogy, the layman public should also be well informed of the social and economic considerations of a project too.\n\u003e \n\u003e Where an oil production site may not necessarily create the most environmentally friendly situation in its current form when (in my opinion unfairly) compared to other ‘green’ projects, the vast economic benefits from tax and royalty revenues as well as the social benefits of creating regional employment and training several generations of skilled labour may lead to more projects where the environmental effects aggregated over these many projects can lead to a net positive environmental result. Civil engineers will need to keep urging the public to see the bigger picture around them.\n\u003e \n\u003e Since the ICE and numerous other engineering bodies started its public campaigns such as those which encourage school children, minority demographics or women into STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) there has been a greater public awareness and celebration of engineering. A few decades ago there may not have been many people who knew many of the technological titans of past and present. Alan Turing, Marie Curie, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Bill Gates. In recent times the Royal Academy of Engineering has two oil/gas industry seniors as their President – Denis Rooke and John Browne.\n\u003e \n\u003e # **Conclusion**\n\u003e \n\u003e The key areas that civil engineers will need to improve upon are the collaboration with policy and decision makers, and to interact more with the wider public about all the pillars of sustainable development.\n\u003e \n\u003e While the oil industry can still suffer from an image of environmental chaos, with the rise of user-generated mass media and international government collaborations such as the recent Paris summit, there has never been a better opportunity for civil engineers working in the petroleum industry to create public awareness and debate of the benefits or disadvantages of their work.\n\n_Tim discusses the essay further…_\n\nWhen I finished writing this and read it through, I knew it would be fine – it certainly meets the “tidy first draft” requirement that ICE use as their passing standard. As confident as it sounds, professional engineers (even students) need to get into the habit of checking their work as they go along. I timed myself and kept to the 2 hours as mandated by ICE. My approximate breakdown of timing was as follows:\n\n-   Planning and structure – 20 mins\n-   Writing the essay – 1hr 35 mins\n-   Checking – 5 mins.\n\nI will be the first to admit that the essay has areas of improvement, but as a passing standard for CEng it is sufficient. With about 15 minutes to go, I had not even started writing my conclusion, so I had to make the trade off and accept that the conclusion would be a bit rough if I were to have enough time to proof-read the rest. Due to the shortage of time, I could only check for obvious spelling and grammatical mistakes, and leaving off anything which requires re-phrasing a sentence. Hence a couple of sentences do sound clumsy, but that is the difference between “A tidy first draft” and “ready for publication”.\n\nI would have liked least 10 to 15 minutes for proof reading, so those extra minutes need to be subtracted from somewhere like the planning, for which large portions can be prepared at home before you arrive for your Written Exercise. (Obviously you will not know the question in advance, but you can prepare lots of useful information ahead).\n\n## **Things you should try to take forward to your review**\n\nYou will note that the Introduction starts off with a narrative feel. This is a nice way to set the tone, and lead the reader into the rest of the essay. I chose one of the most recent oil disasters as something to remind the reader of our collective obligation to society. The last paragraph describes my working position and therefore any stance or bias for the rest of the essay. You could probably imagine if Greenpeace or someone who was not an engineer wrote this, then the arguments put forward would be different.\n\nI decided to use broad headings to allow my argument to develop within. For things like a technical report I might use more rigid sub-headings, but this exercise is meant to act as a creative or expressive piece of writing, so broader headings it was. You will also note that on several occasions I have **expressed my opinion** which is **critical** to passing. As a candidate for CEng level you will need to demonstrate your capacity to lead the industry, which in the case of an essay which has “discuss” in its title, will mean giving your personal opinion. Sometimes candidates fear that this will work against them if the examiner does not like it, but it is the opposite that is true. **You will only be marked down if your opinion is not supported by well-reasoned logic or evidence.** The examiner cannot fail you for disagreeing with your opinion alone.\n\nYou should also note I have dropped in several references to demonstrate breadth of knowledge and reading outside my work. This is expected of all candidates and forms part of [7. Professional Commitment](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Professional%20Review%20MOC/7.%20Professional%20Commitment.md) and your Continuous Professional Development. You will not have time to do a proper references table system at the end, so you should just mention them in the body of the text as you go along.\n\n**Things to improve**\n\nObviously the conclusion is short and somewhat abrupt. As explained, I did not have enough time to write more. What would I have done if I had the time? I may have continued the Macondo Well story from the introduction in a similar narrative style. Alternatively I may have invented a new short story on the same theme, something along the lines of:\n\n\u003e It is now the year 2030 and Sarah Jones is receiving her degree certificate on stage in front of hundreds of applauding parents. The Chancellor warmly congratulates her for a brilliant degree classification – First Class Masters of Civil Engineering – and everyone settles to hear valedictorian speech. Three hours after the event, the truth is not many remember what she has said, except for the nugget of information that inspired her into the industry.\n\u003e \n\u003e As a little girl at a weekend government-sponsored STEM event she had learned about the Macondo Well incident and had felt so disgusted by its aftermath that she had been compelled to dedicate her career to the betterment of society and civil engineering. Many of the parents, also civil engineers, attending empathised with her. They too were graduates around the time of the 2010 incident and had felt a sense of pride that their efforts to communicate to the next generation were bearing fruits of their labour.\n\n…and then continued on with the original conclusion (with some minor modifications) from the original essay.\n\n## **Quality Check**\n\nTo be extra sure of my thoughts, I sought feedback from [Mike Rogers](https://thecivilengineeringexam.com/introduction/about-us/) to confirm my thoughts. Here are some of his comments\n\n\u003e In my view an acceptable Written Exercise at the CEng level\n\u003e \n\u003e -   A well presented WE with a clear layout and structure\n\u003e -   A good introduction and good links to personal role as well as the global challenges\n\u003e -   Good to see a discussion with points of view being made\n\u003e -   The WE was an interesting read and contained some good references\n\u003e \n\u003e Just a minor point and very minor in reality, the conclusion could have been a little stronger in pulling the threads together but this is not a big concern.\n\nAs you can see, the feedback is in line with what I expected.\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nThis page has presented a whole Written Exercise submission to the level of CEng and discussions on strong points and possible improvements. You should keep practising writing essays, especially if English is not your first language or if writing does not come naturally to you. Just remember that a “tidy first draft” will probably contain an occasional grammatical mistake, but presents all the key arguments that you put forward in a logical and fluid manner.\n\n\n\n\nNavigation: [Homepage](_index.md), [Civil Engineering MOC](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC.md), [Areas MOC](Areas%20MOC)\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-16T06:15:21.485497775Z","tags":null},"/notes/Compensation-Event-CE":{"title":"Compensation Event (CE)","content":"# Compensation Event (CE)\nA compensation event is a reassessment of cost or the allocated time to complete a task due to events outside the control of the Subcontractor.

If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what actually gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`.

It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n🔗 [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n### Ignoring Files\nOnly want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n❌ [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md)\n\n### Folder Structure\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\n\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.*\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\nenableToc: false # do not show a table of contents on this page\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet.

Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`.\n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`.\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-06-16T06:15:21.509498153Z","tags":null}}
