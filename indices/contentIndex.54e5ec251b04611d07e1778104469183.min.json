{"/":{"title":"üî® üå≥ The Civil Engineering Garden","content":"![banner](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220721150448.png)\n\nHi! My name is Dan Mackley and I am a civil engineer, working in the construction industry. This digital garden is a way for me to record and share information for future civil engineers, and act as a way to document my learning.\n\n - See my [Digital Garden Philosophy](notes/Digital%20Garden%20Philosophy.md)\n\n## Get Started\n### How it started\nI first started the practice of better note-taking when I became interested in the [second brain](Second%20Brain) movement, brought to my attention by [Ali Abdaal](People/Ali%20Abdaal.md) and [Tiago Forte](People/Tiago%20Forte.md). I wanted a way to record and link my experience and knowledge as I started working towards my [professional review](notes/Professional%20Review%20MOC.md). Over time this has grown to become a vital part of my [personal knowledge management](notes/Personal%20Knowledge%20Management.md) system, and now I am wanting to expand this so others can use it too.\nI will treat this as a [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening/), tending and growing notes as I gain more knowledge.\n\n### How it works\nThis website contains a number of different pages, including methodologies, definitions, examples and reflections on civil engineering practice, some book summaries and other materials. \nTo navigate around the site, simply click on something that looks interesting or use the search tool at the top to find something specific. \nCertain bigger topics will have a [Map of Content (MOC)](notes/Map%20of%20Content%20(MOC).md) which acts as a homepage of sorts to help direct you to useful information. You can use #tags to search for certain page types.\nTo get navigate to the previous page, use the \"Backlinks\" section at the bottom of the page.\n\n - üëâ Get started with the üîß [Civil Engineering MOC](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC.md)\n - üí° See my other interests üìñ [Areas MOC](notes/Areas%20MOC.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.610290073Z","tags":null},"/People/Ali-Abdaal":{"title":"Ali Abdaal","content":"# Ali Abdaal\n\nAli Abdaal is a educational YouTuber, known for his work making videos around medicine, university and creating a business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.610290073Z","tags":null},"/People/Ed-McCann":{"title":"Ed McCann","content":"# Ed McCann\n\nEd McCann was the 2021 president of the [Institution of Civil Engineers](notes/Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers.md); the 157th to hold the post.\n\nHis main aim for his tenure as ICE president is to promote increased productivity, through the terms \"efficiency\" and \"effectiveness\".\n\nüìù More can be found in his [2021 ICE Presidential Address Notes](notes/2021%20ICE%20Presidential%20Address%20Notes.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.610290073Z","tags":null},"/People/Tiago-Forte":{"title":"Tiago Forte","content":"# Tiago Forte\n\nTiago Forte is an an author and proprietor of the [Second Brain](Second%20Brain) method of thinking.

Rachel does not regret her theme - it appears that each President has their own theme to target throughout their tenure. They engage with others in the industry and aim to push this forward.\n\n[jcien.2021.174.1.3.pdf](https://res.craft.do/user/full/0db37624-91b1-c7b3-d592-855defa59de7/doc/8fd5ec25-ae3e-452f-b668-7e357ec46b73/aaadf628-5f05-406f-8c76-d0fabf930f45)\n\nRachel discusses her change in approach as the year progressed, from attacking the decarbonisation, looking more long term, to appreciating that the defensive approach and dealing with the current effects and dealing with them is just as important. Understanding, packaging and distributing the issue in a comprehensible way is very important.\n\nThe next step is taking this understanding and appreciation, and moving to \"how\" do we deal with this. We will be judged on our approach and action in dealing with the climate crisis.\n\n---\n\nPasses over to Ed to explain his theme and approach.\n\nClimate change is the key challenge we face in the 21st century.\n\n3 steps:\n\n1) Understand and accept role\n2) Stop emitting carbon, reduce emissions\n3) Adapt by focusing on improvement\n\n\u003e Aristotle - 'the unexamined life is not worth living'.\n\nInsert background to Ed.\n\n\"importance of critical thinking of deep understanding when trying to identify and solve problems\"\n\n\"importance of understanding impact on people who have to live with your solutions\"\n\n\"if you dont understand the construction process, you cannot design\"\n\nspeaks about endemic over-specification and the effect of this on carbon emissions\n\nspeaks about the lack of techniques and technology being used to collect data, plan and operate effectively. He led research into costs of error in construction. Between 10-25% construction costs down to error.\n\n---\n\n**How to thrive in the 21st century - video**\n\nWe need to change\n\n- our personal motivations\n- climate change\n- stigma towards ai\n\nwhat are we going to do?\n\nhow are we going to do it?\n\neffectiveness - do the correct thing, good solution\n\nefficiency -  do that without unneccesary waste or harm\n\n**Productivity is the key driver for tackling issues. Productivity is a combination of effectiveness and efficiency.**\n\nMain causes of failure (using soup example):\n\n- overordering\n- using the wrong tools\n- waste\n\nRecent studies show wasteful behaviours, time, energy, information, data.\n\nEncourages individuals to assess their own effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nDiversity - bring in all human capability and ideas into targeting problems. Data scientists, community engagement specialists, widen the horizons to start effective collaboration to target productivity. Between countries, disciplines, companies etc.\n\nHard to bring these in:\n- unstable supply chain, moving goalposts\n- new technologies are not commercially accepted to bring in.\n\nMany companies short term benefit from over designing or issues where the climate is affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.726290125Z","tags":null},"/notes/2022-Presidential-Address-Notes":{"title":"2022 Presidential Address Notes","content":"# 2022 Presidential Address Notes\n\n[Keith Howells](notes/Keith%20Howells.md) takes over from [Ed McCann](People/Ed%20McCann.md), as ICE President for 2022.\n\nüïô See last year's notes: [2021 ICE Presidential Address Notes](notes/2021%20ICE%20Presidential%20Address%20Notes.md)\n\n## Starts with [[Ed McCann]], reviewing the past year\n*What have we done to address carbon this year?*\n\n- Working to revise PAS 2080 and produce guidance documentation.\n- Carbon Champions Programme\n- Established UK low carbon concrete board, sets out the way to de-carbonising concrete.\n- Produced content around carbon literacy, uploaded to the ICE literary hub.\n\nPersonally, [Ed McCann](People/Ed%20McCann.md) has been addressing and defining productivity within civil engineering, producing the State of the Nation report which sets out focus areas.

Refers to the [ICE Royal Charter](notes/ICE%20Royal%20Charter.md): *\"Many important works which contribute to the well-being of society are dependent on civil engineers, and call for a high degree of professional knowledge and judgement; there should be a ready means of ascertaining persons who by proper training and experience are qualified to carry out such works.\"*\n\u003e \tb) Calls for continuing professional development improvement, highlighted in the [\"In plain sight: assuring the whole-lift safety of infrastructure\" ICE publication](attachments/in-plain-sight.pdf).\n\u003e \tc) Reiterates CPD guidance and topic on the [ICE website](https://www.ice.org.uk/careers-learning/).\n\u003e 2) To put the decarbonisation of our industry at the heart of our agenda\n\u003e 3) To transform the productivity of our industry through modern methods of procurement and construction, including the widespread use of data and digital technology\n\u003e 4) To work with others to build resilience and mitigate the effects of climate change on our infrastructure\n\u003e \ta) Look to nature based solutions where available\n\u003e 5) To transform the availability of water, sanitation and affordable clean energy, particularly in the global south\n\u003e \ta) Calls to alleviate hardship in lesser-developed areas in regards to the availability of clean drinking water. Highlights climate change responsible for changing rainfall patterns, making farming unpredictable as well as changing the composition of farmland. The effect on wildlife and the combustibility of plants and crops is also highlighted.\n\u003e \tb) Highlights the [flash-flooding in Pakistan](https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/devastating-floods-pakistan-2022) as another example of climate change.\n\u003e 6) To develop a technology-focused mobility and transportation programme, to facilitate a reduction in the carbon intensity of transport\n\u003e 7) To work with others to enhance the knowledge, insight and ethical understanding of engineers\n\u003e \ta) Calls upon engineers to increase their knowledge and awareness of issues in the world in regards to safety. This can lead to practical solutions which can target the [SDGs](notes/UNESCO%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goals.md). \n\u003e \t\n\nThe problems arising from climate change will be addressed by small, incremental changes over time.\n\n\u003e \"We need to become outcome, not output focused; delivering our projects in a way that are generally sustainable, so that we create a viable future for generations to come.\"\n\nOutput = road or bridge\nOutcome = connecting communities, increasing industry and transit, improving family links\n\n#### What does this look like in the real world?\nPlays a video showing good awareness and use to target the [UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals](notes/UNESCO%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goals.md). \n\nIn Scotland, a monitoring and canal technology allows the development of 3000 new homes, which would lead to more people in the area within the city, leading into health benefits and wider benefits arising from sustainable development. Gives access to affordable housing.\n\nIn India, an ancient drainage system was insufficient to drain the climate related flooding. A machine was lowered into the sewers to remove the silting and address damage. A low-friction lining was placed into the sewer to allow the material to drain much quicker. Leads to less illness and money on healthcare due to no waterlogged streets.\n\nIn Peru, the El Nino flooding affected 1 million people. The UK \"Reconstruction with Changes\" is constructing 15 hospitals, 74 schools and flood management infrastructure in a 1.7 billion pound regeneration project. Monitoring is installed to alert for flash-flood risks, and earthquake and flooding resistant schools and hospitals have been installed. Landscaping and trees have been installed to capture carbon, reduce emissions and increase sustainability.\n\n### What is the ICE currently doing to address these goals?\n\n - Decarbonisation - collaborated with the BSI to update PAS 2080, the standard for managing carbon in the delivery of infrastructure projects. Worked with the Low Carbon Concrete Group, to produce a route-map of better methods to reduce carbon in concrete.\n - Productivity - [State of the Nation report](attachments/state_of_the_nation_working_paper_final-1.pdf). Enabling Better Infrastructure Programme is a vital resource for decision makers. Next UN review of the SDGs is going to focus on Infrastructure - the ICE will be giving feedback and updates.\n - The ICE acknowledges they cannot do everything, so collaboration has been promoted: for example, with the [International Coalition for Sustainable Infrastructure](https://www.resilienceshift.org/international-coalition-for-sustainable-infrastructure/).\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.726290125Z","tags":null},"/notes/Areas-MOC":{"title":"Areas MOC","content":"# Areas\nI have many different interests, from music to hot-air ballooning!

This should be applied to other industries as well, enhancing and preserving existing assets to ensure that they can be used for generations to come.\n\n## Physical assets\n### What benefits are there to managing assets?\n - Generates efficiency gains\n - Reduces carbon emissions and improves sustainability\n - Prioritises investment where it is required\n - Creates economic prosperity\n - Helps key decision makers effectively create, develop and operate their assets\n - Improves asset longevity\n\n### What barriers are there to delivering asset management?\n - Funding issues\n - Lack of resources and knowledge\n - Competing priorities\n - Inspection and maintenance inconsistency\n - Data management\n - Life cycle engineering\n - Conservation and heritage\n\n#### How can we promote asset management?\n - At all levels, try to embrace the principles and philosophy of asset management and work together to promote this. Thinking about the end product and how the asset will be managed following handover.\n - Professional bodies can assist by providing the right expertise, knowledge and approach to delivery a consistent service.\n\n## Digital assets\n\n\n\u003e [!NOTE] Digital assets\n\u003e There is a whole landscape of digital assets which can be controlled in a similar way to physical assets. The threat of malware, rapid replacement cycles and the aggressive threat landscape can be a hindrance to the promotion of digital assets however. \n\n#### Why do we need cyber security?\nCyber security can make private and sensitive information secure against an outside or inside threat. The common methods of cyber attack are:\n\n1) Insider - an Insider threat can be defined as ‚Äòa current or former employee, contractor or other business partner with access to the organization‚Äôs network, system or data and intentionally misuses them or whose access results in misuse‚Äô.\n2) Phishing - phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source, usually through email. The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information.\n3) In-path interception - also known as eavesdropping attacks, occur when attackers insert themselves into a two-party transaction. Common points of entry: on unsecure public Wi-Fi and via previously inserted malware.\n4) Malware - Malware is a term used to describe a family of malicious software, including spyware, ransomware, viruses, and worms. Malware breaches a network through a vulnerability, to: block or obtain access to key network components.\n5) Web Attacks and DoS - a family of sophisticated techniques to exploit unpatched software and web applications.\n\nThere is a whole host of legislation around network and information security.\n\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020221116150607.png)\n\n#### Day-to-day management of cyber-security\nThere are very few contractual obligations to ensure cyber-security within an organisation. However, general ethics dictate a duty-of-care should be employed to protect user's security. Fundamentally, ISO 55001 has cyber security at it's core.\n\nWe can protect cyber security with a 6-step process:\n1) Analyse\n2) Plan\n3) Implement\n4) Monitor\n5) Respond\n6) Review\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.726290125Z","tags":null},"/notes/Avoiding-Danger-from-Overhead-Power-Lines-GS6-2013":{"title":"Avoiding Danger from Overhead Power Lines (GS6) (2013)","content":"# Avoiding Danger from Overhead Power Lines (GS6) (2013)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.726290125Z","tags":null},"/notes/BS-6031-2009":{"title":"BS 6031 2009","content":"# BS 6031 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.726290125Z","tags":null},"/notes/Beth-Kempton":{"title":"Beth Kempton","content":"# Beth Kempton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.726290125Z","tags":null},"/notes/Blog-Piece":{"title":"Blog Piece","content":"# Blog Piece\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.726290125Z","tags":null},"/notes/Book-Summaries":{"title":"Book Summaries","content":"# Book Summaries / Reflections\nAs part of tending my own [Digital Garden](notes/Digital%20Garden.md), whenever I read a book I summarise it, try and get some actionable points from it and keep it for future reference. \n\n## 2022\n - [Kaizen - Sarah Harvey (2020)](notes/Kaizen%20-%20Sarah%20Harvey%20(2020).md)\n - [Wabi Sabi - Beth Kempton (2018)](notes/Wabi%20Sabi%20-%20Beth%20Kempton%20(2018).md)\n - [Taste - Stanley Tucci (2021)](notes/Taste%20-%20Stanley%20Tucci%20(2021).md)\n - [Tough - Terry Crews (2022)](notes/Tough%20-%20Terry%20Crews%20(2022).md)\n - [How to be Perfect - Mike Schur (2022)](notes/How%20to%20be%20Perfect%20-%20Mike%20Schur%20(2022).md)\n - [Four Thousand Weeks - Oliver Burkeman (2021)](notes/Four%20Thousand%20Weeks%20-%20Oliver%20Burkeman%20(2021).md)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.726290125Z","tags":null},"/notes/Briefing-Note":{"title":"Briefing Note","content":"# Briefing Note\n\n\n\u003e [!NOTE] Briefing Note\n\u003e *A briefing paper, or briefing note, is a document that is used to **inform decision makers** (a board, a politician, etc.)¬†on current issues.¬† It is a clear and concise document that¬†summarizes an issue and **identifies key pieces of information** like a situation that needs to be addressed and the **financial implications**.¬† Briefing papers can also **offer recommendations** on how to address the issues.*\n\u003e \n\u003e A briefing note, similar to a [Summary Note](notes/Summary%20Note.md) is intended to provide a summary of a topic to a third-party without resorting to technical language.

These are:\n\n- Offer - goods, services, product or money must be offered. \n- Acceptance - a party must provide verbal or written acceptance.\n- Monetary Value - an exchange must be present to accept the offer.\n\nThere are a few different easy definitions of contracts, one is \"the rules of the game\", and another is \"the allocation of [[risk]]\". The choice of which contract is applied to certain work packages entirely depends on the level of risk to be taken on by the Client and the Contractor. This can dictate whether a [Priced Contract](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Commercial%20MOC/Priced%20Contract.md) or [[Target Cost]] is applied.\n\nThe [[NEC3]] contract, with which I have had the most experience, is broken down into the following key sections:\n\n - [[Core Clauses]] \n - Option Clauses ([[Option A Activity Schedule]], [[Option B Bill of Quantities]] etc.)\n - [[W Clauses]] - dispute resolution\n - [[X Clauses]] - ways to implement the recovery and provision of money\n - [[Z Clauses]] - deviations and adjustments to the standard form of contract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/Civil-Engineering-MOC/Commercial-MOC/Priced-Contract":{"title":"Priced Contract","content":"# Priced Contract\nPriced contracts are where a lump sum of work is allocated for a project, and money is released under different conditions. This generally places more risk on the contractor carrying out the work, as if the works are more expensive than estimated, the contractor must bear that cost. Conversely however, savings can also benefit the contractor.\n\n**[[Option A Activity Schedule]]** - This is a form of contract where money is released based on activities being completed. I tend to remember this by thinking that this contract type is more suitable for activities where the exact quantity is hard to define. For example, this contract type is more applicable to a package such as Vegetation Clearance; an activity might be to clear a section of site. The contractor can create this Activity Schedule and agree it with the client. If this was an Option B contract, it would require the individual number of trees to be defined and costed accordingly, which would become unfeasible. The lump sum agreed is open to change through the use of [[Compensation Event (CE)]]s if additional activities are required.\n\nThe advantage of an [[Option A Activity Schedule]] for a Client is that it improves cost certainty and transfers this [[risk]] to the contractor. Contrary to an [[Option B Bill of Quantities]] contract, where the contractor can start work and charge for the materials used by remeasuring, the Client knows upfront what each activity is going to cost and it is down to the Contractor to ensure the activities are completed under budget to make profit. There is almost zero-risk for the client in a case like this.\n\n**[[Option B Bill of Quantities]]** - Contrary to Option A, the work is priced in physical units, set out in a Bill of Quantities. An applicable works package for use with this contract may be a bored piling contractor, where the exact number of piles is known from the start and therefore the materials required to complete the work can be derived. It may set out the quantity of concrete for a pile pour, the hire of the plant needed, the cost of steelwork, and everything else related to the work. One benefit this has over the Option A contract is that money can be released as material are used and a proportion of work is completed, contrary to Option A where money is released only when an activity has been fully completed.\n\nIn the [[Allocation of Risk]] debate, the [[Option B Bill of Quantities]] contract transfers much more risk towards the Client. The costs are much harder to control and predict. To incorporate a level of certainty for the Client, the contract can contain a set of [[Disallowed Costs]]. These generally include [[Preliminaries]], which include costs for labour, staff, overheads, site security and everything that facilitates the completion of the work. It does not include the actual cost of materials. This incentivises the Contractor to complete the project to the key dates set out by the Client.\n\nWithout certain measures, a Contractor could start work and remeasure heavily in their favour. There would be little recourse if the \n\nThere is a distinct difference between Option A and B in that in Option A, payment is only issued when an activity is \"fully completed\". In other contracts, there can be the issue of payment under certain circumstances for \"partial\" or \"substantial\" completion, however this is not the case under [[NEC3]]. \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/Civil-Engineering-MOC/Design-MOC/Design-MOC":{"title":"üíª Design MOC","content":"# Design MOC\nI started completing civil engineering design work as part of a [[Temporary Works]] design team.

Understanding and Practical Application of Engineering\nThis Attribute is subdivided into 8 parts if you are aiming for Chartered Engineer level.\n\n\u003e A) Maintain and extend knowledge of engineering theory and practice, and how technology assists its application\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Solve engineering problems using a sound theoretical approach, based on evidence, and contribute to continuous improvement\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Engage in the creation and/or introduction of new, advancing or improved techniques and technology\n\u003e \n\u003e D) Identify, review and select techniques, procedures and methods to undertake engineering tasks\n\u003e \n\u003e E) Take an active role in the identification and definition of requirements, challenges, risks, and opportunities and undertake appropriate investigation and action\n\u003e \n\u003e F) Contribute to the design and development of engineering solutions, implement those solutions, and evaluate their effectiveness in the context of the whole project life cycle\n\u003e \n\u003e G) Undertake the design, development and implementation of engineering solutions and evaluate their effectiveness in the context of the whole project life cycle\n\u003e \n\u003e H) Exercise sound independent engineering judgement\n\nFor IEng level you need to satisfy A), B), D), F), and H), while for CEng level you need to satisfy all eight. But what is the difference between them?\n\nThe A) and B) are about getting your knowledge up to the current industry best practices, while C) and D) are about taking it further. Of course as a CEng applicant you will need to know what the current best practices are before you attempt anything new. Similar to how you would perform a literature review in an academic thesis in the first chapter.\n\nThere is not an expectation to create something totally new, but more appropriately a small amendment in how things were previously done¬†which brings improvement for the industry or the society. For instance:\n\n-   Did you amend a concrete pouring sequence to save 2% of total concrete volume, or speed up the process by 3%?\n-   Did you manage to automate via a computer script a boring but important engineering job to save time for everyone and free up resources?\n-   Did you do a bit of research behind a building design code and notice some leeway to deviate under certain situations?\n\nIf you studied for a Masters or Doctorate degree then satisfying this Attribute should be fairly straightforward, as the requirements to pass those degrees are in line with what is required here.\n\nRemember you need to show capability to do the above, so think broadly, even if your evidences are not so relevant to your daily work. For instance, you can demonstrate your eagerness to learn through attending all sorts of courses and conferences, and for CEng ‚Äì applying this newly gained knowledge in your role. You may have helped a friend to design an extension to his house and had to do background research. (Though this last example on its own probably would not get you through a review.)\n\nJust remember the main things to you will need to demonstrate in your portfolio and review are:\n\n-   Curiosity and self-initiative\n-   Ability to learn by yourself\n-   Why your new, and old, knowledge is beneficial to engineering\n-   How you are able to introduce your new idea/technique into industry.

Management and Leadership\nWhat does this mean exactly? If you read the text carefully from the first attribute, you will notice that half of the sub-attributes relate to whether you are driving the industry forward with your engineering research or application. A similar concept applies to this Attribute but in the context of management processes.\n\nThis Attribute is divided as follows\n\n\u003e A) Plan the work and resources needed to enable effective implementation of engineering tasks and projects\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Manage the planning and organisation of tasks and resources.\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Manage (organise, direct and control), programme or schedule, tasks and resources\n\u003e \n\u003e D) Manage teams or technical specialisms\n\u003e \n\u003e E) Lead or influence teams / technical specialisms, understanding the limits of their skills and knowledge\n\u003e \n\u003e F) Assist others to meet changing technical and managerial needs\n\u003e \n\u003e G) Develop others to meet changing technical and managerial needs\n\u003e \n\u003e H) Manage quality processes and contribute to quality improvements\n\u003e \n\u003e I) Demonstrate continuous quality improvement and promote best practice\n\nParts A), B), D), F), and H) are a requirement for IEng whilst CEng requires all nine attributes to be satisfied. The difference being that CEng requires you to demonstrate you can lead by example and evaluate processes for continual improvement; whilst IEng is simply management of the status quo.\n\n\u003e Lessons Learnt ‚Äì always a powerful tool of evaluation and continuous improvement¬†[Source](https://pixabay.com/en/photos/checklist/)\n\nThe key to achieving this attribute is to avoid succumbing to complacency. If any process, no matter how small or big, goes well it is easy to pat each other's back and call it a job well done. But you should always record some form of after action review, whether formally or privately, and ask yourself the following questions:\n\n-   What went well?\n-   What went not so well?\n-   Was it to programme?\n-   Was it to budget?\n-   Was it to satisfactory quality?\n-   Was it sustainable?\n-   What were the bottlenecks in the processes?\n-   How did I manage any difficulties I came across?\n-   Is it possible to get feedback from others I worked with?\n-   What could I do differently next time with knowledge I gained from this experience?\n\n\nOn the topic of technical and managerial needs, you are required to show how you identified opportunities to improve your colleagues' abilities in new technologies or skills. For instance, you may have:\n\n-   Delivered seminars on the latest revisions to design codes or regulations, e.g. CDM 2015 or EN/ISO design code revisions\n-   Making adjustments to a document control or other registry tool and assisting staff with its implementation\n-   Created a computer script to automate labour-intensive tasks and gotten people to use it.\n-   Led H\u0026S inspections and implementation on site\n-   Identified commercial issues and developing a process to mitigate them  \n    Influencing teams the benefits of BIM; tweaking existing processes to suit BIM and implementing training and workshops in relation to rollout of BIM\n\nThe good thing about this Attribute is that you should be able to show Chartership qualities in your working behaviour from day one, even if it takes some further time to collect your evidence. With the right mentality of always striving to improve everything, if you can keep demonstrating your application of learnings then you should be able to satisfy this attribute very quickly.\n\nüëâ Next: [3.

Compare this to 53% of UK applicants and 47% of those from the Rest of the World (Source: SCE Newsletter February 2014).\n\nFor ICE Trainees in large companies this Attribute can sometimes be tricky to satisfy especially if you are working in a position which does not easily permit you to manage commercial aspects of projects or business.\n\nHere are the Sub-Attributes for this section:\n\n\u003e A) Manage, prepare and control costs/budgets of engineering tasks or projects\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Manage, prepare and control costs/budgets of a significant engineering task or project\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Use sound knowledge of statutory and commercial frameworks within their own area of responsibility and have an appreciation of other commercial arrangements\n\u003e \n\u003e D) Demonstrate sound judgement on statutory, contractual and commercial issues in relation to own area of responsibility\n\nPart A) by itself is actually a requirement for Incorporated Engineer level, so this should indicate that a Chartered Engineer will need to be pretty strong¬†in financial capabilities. This does not necessarily mean you need to be as good as a qualified accountant!\n\nSince almost every engineer should (in theory) be good at mathematics, the process of learning the calculations behind budgets should not pose as a difficult challenge in itself ‚Äì but just acquiring the exposure to commercial activities and tasks.\n\nIt is wise to learn your company's business processes; your project's legal and contractual framework and related terms and conditions; in addition to gaining awareness of your company's financial systems used.¬† As a minimum, you should know the answers to ALL of the following:\n\n-   In which jurisdiction(s) do your contracts apply?\n-   What are the terms and conditions in the contract?\n-   How are the contracts formed? (e.g. competitive bidding? What stipulations are required?)\n-   Who are the responsible parties in your contracts, and what are their duties?\n-   What are the consequences of non-compliance to the contract?\n-   What variations (including breakouts) are permissible in your contracts, or how can parties agree to them?\n-   What are the remedial actions permitted or stated in your contract (if any)?\n-   What are the mechanisms/processes in your business that need to be done to arrange payment to an external party?\n\n\nCan you define the term ‚Äú[[Contract]]‚Äù? What is your exposure to the various types?¬†[Source](http://www.thebluediamondgallery.com/highlighted/c/contract.html)\n\nTo demonstrate ‚Äúsound judgement‚Äù, your reviewers may test your ability by asking you to discuss in significant detail the strengths and weaknesses of the contracts you deal with, or any improvements you would suggest for next time.\n\nOn business processes, perhaps if a particular item parameter were modified somewhere in the process, would you have a good idea of the potential consequences to the rest of the process? What amendments would be required in order to enable that modification to take place, or if it is impossible, what would the next best option be and what would its disadvantage be compared to the original method?\n\nIf you have evidence of playing an influential part in the commercial aspects of your work then this is of course the best way to demonstrate your competence. Otherwise, you may have to draw on any other experiences such as running societies or charitable organisations outside work ‚Äì but alone this will not be enough to satisfy the Reviewers.\n\nNevertheless, the best commercial experiences can be gained from placements within the estimating and commercial departments ‚Äì or at least performing tasks and activities on behalf of those in those departments. Such tasks could include monitoring labour, plant, materials and equipment used for activities on site; and using that data for calculating costs on behalf of the Quantity Surveyor. Alternatively, that data could be extrapolated for benchmarking, pricing and estimating similar projects in the future.\n\nüëâ Next: [4.

In addition, ICE Trainees should be able to facilitate the improvement of Health, Safety \u0026 Welfare (H\u0026SW) on construction sites ‚Äì whether that is during the design stage or whilst during the construction phase.\n\nThe sub-Attributes are:\n\n\u003e A) Demonstrate a sound knowledge of legislation, hazards and safe systems of work\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Manage risks\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Manage health, safety and welfare within their own area of responsibility\n\u003e \n\u003e D) Contribute to improvements in health, safety and welfare\n\u003e \n\u003e E) Demonstrate leadership by promoting good practice and improvements in health, safety and welfare\n\nParts A) ‚Äì D) are a requirement for IEng, with E) the extra requirement for CEng.\n\nWhile health and safety is often discussed at work, relatively little attention is given to welfare. A working environment may be seen as safe, but how do the workers feel about their conditions there? How might someone working on an offshore oil platform feel about spending 4 weeks at a time away from family with the facilities around him/her?\n\nMental Health is often overlooked in the workplace¬†[Source](https://pixabay.com/en/mental-health-wellness-psychology-2019924/)\n\nMental health, stress and work/life balance is also a growing issue around the world and should be contemplated by ICE Trainees.\n\nThe likelihood is that your reviewers will monitor¬†this Attribute very strictly because of how easy it is to become complacent, and the potentially fatal consequences of complacency.\n\nCandidates should be able to demonstrate a strong working knowledge of the following:\n\n-   The applicable laws regarding Health, Safety and Welfare (HS\u0026W) in the countries where your projects are based. (See also our blog post on¬†[whether CDM applies offshore.](http://thestructuralexam.com/2016/08/13/cdm-regulations-apply-offshore/))\n-   Company policies on HS\u0026W and where it might differ (for better or for worse) to local practice.\n-   Industry trends relating to HS\u0026W in your discipline. (For instance, the risks related to offshore oil and gas may differ to onshore timber construction).\n-   Recent incidents, statistics and case studies of H\u0026SW in your country\n-   Implementation of H\u0026SW in your work (whether that is in design, implementation or managing)\n-   New technologies involving H\u0026SW\n\n\nThe best candidates will be able to gain knowledge on how H\u0026SW has evolved over the years to its current state of legislation and current practice, and how the trends may continue.\n\nFor many recent graduates who have embarked on their career in Civil Engineering, their CPD records will probably show a large amount of HS\u0026W training at the start of their IPD, but the subsequent years may show minimal participation or application of that knowledge gained (those particularly guilty of this are office-based consultants and clients). This implicitly violates sub-Attribute E) and continual maintenance on your CPD for HS\u0026W items should be seen as the bare minimum.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to show leadership in HS\u0026W, ranging from conducting risk assessments; writing method statements; organising and chairing H\u0026SW forums and rewriting your company‚Äôs safety procedures (to name a few‚Ä¶). In any case, you should be able to demonstrate the results of how your leadership has made improvements.\n\nüëâ Next: [5.

Sustainable Development\nWhile there are now people making whole careers as environmental specialists, your job as a Chartered Civil Engineer will require very intricate involvement with sustainability studies, as described by these sub-parts.\n\n\u003e A) Understand the principles of sustainable development and apply them in work\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Manage engineering activities that contribute to sustainable development and the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs)\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Take a professional and responsible role in improvements that support sustainable development and reduce resource demand, set in the context of a whole project life cycle\n\nObviously, if you are taking the lead (or at least judged to be capable of it) then you will probably need to have a sound knowledge and be capable of managing some activities relating to sustainable development. Therefore try to focus on C) only.\n\nAll ICE Trainees must be able to define [[Sustainability]].\n\nAs identified by the 2005 World Summit on Sustainable Development, it is typically known that there are the ‚ÄòThree Pillars of Sustainability'. They are:\n\n-   Social\n-   Economical\n-   Environmental\n\n![Sustainable](https://i0.wp.com/thecivilengineeringexam.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sustainabile-1024x653.png?resize=620%2C395)\n\nThe Three Pillars of Sustainability¬†[Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sustainable_development.svg)\n\nThe hot topic of any major civil or structural engineering project in the 21st century is environmental impact. How construction and manufacturing is conducted in the future is now under greater scrutiny since the recent Paris Summit in December 2015. Therefore, to stand a good chance of passing your Review, you should try to demonstrate leadership in the ‚ÄúEnvironmental‚Äù and one of Economical and Social, with at least working knowledge of the last.\n\nIn many cases it should be fairly obvious whether you are doing a piece of work related to sustainability, such as:\n\nWhat have you done to demonstrate that you are working on a sustainable project?¬†[Source](https://pixabay.com/en/co2-global-warming-global-warming-1076817/)\n\n- CO2 emissions reductions calculations for your project.\n- Disposal of products (e.g. facility decommissioning, toxic handling¬†etc.)\n- Waste management in accordance to legislation\n- Improvement of industry standards / technical developments\n- Compliance with changes in legislation\n- Lifetime extensions of buildings/infrastructure\n- Societal impacts caused by your project.\n\nThis Attribute is probably a little less demanding than the others in terms of content and ability. For most people you might not be making the environmental decisions, which is expected. It will just be a case of demonstrating your participation in engineering, and what sustainable benefits your decisions influenced.\n\nüëâ Next: [6.

Interpersonal Skills and Communication\nYou cannot succeed in engineering, or any skilled profession, without strong communication skills. Of all the Attributes you will be reviewed against, this is probably the easiest to fulfil and the one that has strongest transferability should you wish to consider a career change.\n\n\u003e A) Communicate well with others at all levels including effective use of English*, orally and in writing*\n\u003e \n\u003e B) Discuss ideas and plans competently and with confidence\n\u003e \n\u003e C) Communicate new concepts and ideas to technical and non-technical stakeholders\n\u003e \n\u003e D) Demonstrate effective personal and social skills\n\u003e \n\u003e E) Demonstrate awareness of diversity and inclusion\n\u003e \n\u003e F) Proactively manage diversity and inclusion\n\u003e \n\u003e *Subject to the Welsh Language Act.\n\nParts A), B, D), and E) are marked as Incorporated Engineer level, while candidates seeking chartered engineer status need to satisfy all 6 sub-attributes.\n\nThe odd one out in the above sub-Attributes, but definitely not any less worthy, is F), managing diversity issues. This is a recent addition to ICE's criteria but is very important to 21st Century professionalism, as you need to demonstrate that you can work with people of any race, religion, sex, disability, sexual orientation etc. and also to improve inclusiveness in your workplace. A good starting point is¬†[this interview](http://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/careers/diversity-in-engineering/)of Bola Fatimilehin, Head of Diversity at the Royal Academy of Engineering,¬†published in Black History Month 365.\n\nNearly all Professional Reviews will be conducted in English, though there is an archaic law which allows you to take your exam in Welsh instead. From what most reviewers have told us, most candidates in Wales sit their reviews in English.\n\nOn the communications side, you need to be able to be explain, discuss, argue, present all sorts of details to all sorts of audience. You might find you need to describe how glass-reinforced polymers have anisotropic material properties to a group¬†of 10 year old school children with no material science knowledge, or you might one day be delivering a proposal to Parliament and defending yourself against angry protestors on why putting a high speed train line through pristine countryside makes economical, environmental and technical sense.\n\nYou should not worry too much about satisfying the communications aspects of this Attribute if your English is totally fluent. This Attribute is only ever a considerable barrier for those using the European Directive or Mutual Recognition routes and hardly use English in their daily lives. If this is the case, you should seek to continually practise your written and spoken English well¬†ahead of¬†your Review.\n\nüëâ Next: [7.

For instance, one that ALL Professional Review candidates should watch, regardless of the grade you are applying for, is the¬†[James Rennie Medal](https://www.ice.org.uk/careers-and-professional-development/careers-advice-for-civil-engineers/professional-review-awards)¬†which is awarded to the best CEng MICE candidate from the previous year. ¬†TCEE also has some interesting CPD videos that can count towards CPD in the future.\n\n![TCEE CPD Cycle](https://i0.wp.com/thecivilengineeringexam.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TCEE-CPD-3-1024x761.png?resize=620%2C461)\n\nThe CPD Cycle\n\nAt the time of your Professional Review you will need to submit your CPD records, but rather than seeing this as a burden, it is remarkably easy to maintain if you spend just 15 minutes per week or fortnight. Our recommendation is to do it at the same time as you do your timesheets (if you have such a system) as you will need to look back at what you have done for the previous period anyway. It therefore takes little additional effort to get it done. There is a template¬†[.DOCX](https://www.ice.org.uk/my-ice/membership-documents/continuing-professional-development-guidance)¬†file available for use, though the ICE is encouraging everyone to do it online these days.\n\nWith regards to ‚Äúdemonstrating appropriate professional standards‚Äù, well if you can behave yourself that's a good start. You need to show you are committed, passionate and excited about the industry and profession. How can you do this? You can demonstrate this at your interview with good knowledge and opinion on latest developments in particular sectors of civil engineering, policies or environmental concerns. The list is very open ended but this provides a fantastic opportunity to prove yourself to be a good commentator in a chosen sector.\n\nStatistically speaking this Attribute is least likely to cause failure, so you can distribute your focus and efforts to other Attributes as you see appropriate.\n\nüëà Previous: [6.

This can be an individual, partnership or company.\n\nThe distinction between a [commercial client](notes/Commercial%20client.md) and a [domestic client](notes/Domestic%20client.md) is that the following duties apply **in full** to a commercial client, whereas some duties may be passed down the chain in a domestic case.\n\nCommercial clients are critical in managing [health and safety](notes/Health%20and%20Safety.md) on site, including the management of health and safety risks.\n\n\u003e Whatever the project size, the commercial client has contractual control, appoints designers and contractors, and determines the money, time and other resources for the project.\n\n---\nFor all projects, commercial clients must:\n\n-   make suitable arrangements for managing their project, enabling those carrying it out to manage health and safety risks in a proportionate way.

The task aims to validate [6. Interpersonal Skills and Communication](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Professional%20Review%20MOC/6.%20Interpersonal%20Skills%20and%20Communication.md), as well as offer an opportunity for the candidate to demonstrate knowledge and awareness of the wider civil engineering landscape. It is based on the current issues in the industry, and the candidate will be expected to respond as an engaged civil engineer, not a technical expert.\n\n## Format\nAs per the guidance, *You will be set two questions, each containing a scenario and a format. You will have to choose one question to respond to, and you will have 90 minutes to complete the task. At the CPR and CPRP, the aim is to test your ability to take a piece of information, digest it, organise your thoughts and present them logically and clearly, bearing in mind the audience that you are writing to.*.\n\nPrior to the day of your review, an email with links to join the MS Teams meetings will be provided, for both the review and interview itself, and the communication task which will occur later in the day.\n\nThe links should be opened in Incognito/Private Browsing mode, to ensure there are no conflicts if a Microsoft account is already logged in.\n\nOnce you have received the email, you will need to: \n\ta) Open your browser in Incognito/InPrivate mode. (This is to avoid disruption if you already have a SharePoint account) \n\tb) Copy the link and paste it into your browser which will take you to the login page \n\tc) Input your email address and the randomly generated password included with the email you have received\n\n## Examples of questions:\n\n\u003e [!NOTE] Example 1\n\u003e **Nuclear energy and the balance of risk and reward** \n\u003e With global emissions on a seemingly unstoppable upward trend there are clear concerns that civil engineers are adding to the problem of climate change, but the construction of nuclear facilities could be one of a range of ways to reduce emissions. However, when Greenpeace claims ‚Äúnuclear power is incredibly expensive, hazardous and slow to build‚Äù and with the catastrophic failure at Fukushima in 2011 in recent memory, many feel this is the wrong technology to use, and alternatives must be sought. You have been asked to write a piece by a journalist on this subject for inclusion in an industry supplement.\n\n\u003e [!NOTE] Example 2\n\u003e **The need for resilience of infrastructure and how to achieve it.** \n\u003e Covid-19 has shown us that there is a need for resilience to unexpected economic shocks in terms of our infrastructure and its design and maintenance. The time has come for a rethink of what kind of infrastructure is required and how engineers design, build and maintain such infrastructure, as well as what training and development is needed to allow engineers to ensure its fitness for purpose.

The material can be either printed hardcopy or an MS Word document. Other reference materials and notes are not permitted. \n\t‚ñ™ If the invigilator notices that you are using unauthorised materials, they will ask you to stop, and a note will be recorded, and your Reviewers informed \n\t‚ñ™ You are not permitted to talk to anyone during the Communication Task. If you are online, then you should be alone in the room and free of distractions ‚ñ™ You must answer only one out of the two questions \n\t‚ñ™ You will be given a 15-minute warning before the Communication Task is due to finish and then you will be told when you need to stop. You will then be given 15 minutes to upload your response through the portal \n\t‚ñ™ Leaving your seat should be avoided but if you do need to leave for any reason ‚Äì toilet breaks, getting a glass of water etc - you must let your invigilator know, by either putting a message in the chat function or raising your hand. You will not be granted extra time \n\t‚ñ™ If you leave for a significant amount of time or you do not inform the invigilator that you are leaving, this will be considered as breaking the rules and will need to be recorded and your Reviewers informed \n\t‚ñ™ The Communication Task must be your own work. Where you need to quote exactly from others, be sure to fully reference the source, and where appropriate, enclose the material in quotation marks. A good rule of thumb is that you should treat as quotes any material derived from others except content which could be assumed to be common knowledge, e.g., standard equations in the public domain. The use of re-drawn diagrams/figures is allowed if permission is obtained (where appropriate) and the source is acknowledged\n\t‚ñ™ The use of the internet on your computer or any mobile devices is not permitted during the Communication Task, except to access the Teams meeting, the login email from ICE, and the Communication Task page required to carry out the Communication Task \n\t‚ñ™ The use of external hard drives and USB memory sticks are not permitted \n\t‚ñ™ Plagiarism is not acceptable and is taken seriously by ICE. Samples of the Communication Task response will be selected and put through plagiarism detection software, and if this shows significant levels of similarity with any unattributed sources then you will be contacted by the ICE and asked to provide an explanation. Your Reviewers will be provided with a copy of the plagiarism report and your response. Your Reviewers may use this information in the assessment of your Communication Task or other attributes \n\t‚ñ™ Mobile phones must be turned to silent and put to the side\n\n## Submission\nAt the end of the allocated time, the invigilator will ask you to stop writing. There will then be a 15 minute window to save and upload your answer document as a PDF file.\n\n## Marking\nThe Communication Task forms part of the assessment of the Interpersonal Skills and Communication attribute, your written response will be assessed against the following three criteria:\n\n\t‚ñ™ Knowledge and relevance \n\t‚ñ™ Use of English (grammar and syntax) \n\t‚ñ™ Clarity and presentation \n\nPlease remember that at IEng-level your Reviewers are looking for evidence that you can report factual information clearly, while at CEng-level they will be looking for you to organise your thoughts and deliver them in writing in a clear and logical fashion, bearing in mind the needs of the audience you are writing for.","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/Communication-Task-Example":{"title":"Taken from The Civil Engineering Exam(httpsthecivilengineeringexam.comexample-ice-written-exercise-submission) - the Communication Task Example","content":"# Communication Task Example\n\n*Taken from [The Civil Engineering Exam](https://thecivilengineeringexam.com/example-ice-written-exercise-submission/) - the Communication Task Example* \n\nSee more about the [Communication Task](notes/Communication%20Task.md) here.\n\n## ICE Communication Task Example\n\nHere at The Civil Engineering Exam, we constantly learn from each other and try to make sure our skills stay sharp.

Discuss how civil engineers can play a key role in mitigating the impact and altering this perception.**\n\u003e \n\u003e _by Tim Lai, February 2016_\n\u003e \n\u003e # **Introduction**\n\u003e \n\u003e In April 2010 the world‚Äôs spotlight was shone onto the largest manmade environmental disaster to have ever occurred in the world. In the middle of the night, The Deepwater Horizon drill ship was performing routine exploration work on the Macondo Prospect and a surge in subsurface pressure caused a massive explosion on the ship, which caused millions of barrels of oil to flow into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\u003e \n\u003e For nearly three months the general public were bombarded with extremely distressing pictures of sea life covered in thick crude oil and a large proportion of Southern USA had its pristine shoreline irreversibly damaged by a manmade event.\n\u003e \n\u003e A few years later the Federal Bureau of Safety for the US declared that none of the contributing events were caused by civil engineers. Yet in the oil industry, every person regardless of skill is judged by its weakest performer.\n\u003e \n\u003e In the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) Code of Conduct, there is the explicit requirement of Rule 4 that all members ‚Äúshow due regard for the environment and for the sustainable management of natural resources‚Äù. From my experience working at the forefront of academic research in pipeline integrity and as a structural engineer for one of the world‚Äôs largest Petrochemical Operators, this essay discusses how I feel civil engineers can take the industry forward in two particular ways. Firstly about mitigating the impact of the negative perception about harm to the environment. Secondly it addresses some steps towards altering and thus improving the perception from here forth.\n\u003e \n\u003e # **Mitigation of impact**\n\u003e \n\u003e The UN Summit of Stockholm in 1972 on Human Environment set 26 Principles that mankind should adhere to in order to create an environmentally sustainable planet. Its chairperson, Harlem Brundtland is attributed to coining a key guideline for all persons of every walk of life to follow:\n\u003e \n\u003e ‚ÄúSustainability development meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e The 26 Principles from the Declaration of the Conference are broadly set out in 5 themes:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1.  The requirements for a dignified human existence and the comfort levels associated with it.\n\u003e 2.  The global economy should facilitate progress towards a better environment\n\u003e 3.  Environmental considerations should play an integral part of development planning\n\u003e 4.  Forming and allowing the right people and organisations to perform research towards sustainable development and then keeping the public educated\n\u003e 5.  Each signatory country‚Äôs obligations to its neighbours and the necessity of co-operation.\n\u003e \n\u003e Since the Stockholm Conference, there have been further high-profile gatherings at Rio de Janeiro, Berlin, Kyoto, Doha and Paris which set further specific measures and targets (and in some cases legally-binding) for signatory parties to cut their emissions.\n\u003e \n\u003e With the correct framework and cooperation with governments ranging from local all the way to international scale, civil engineers can and have a duty to play a crucial part in all of the above themes.\n\u003e \n\u003e Civil engineers must provide expert opinion and analysis to policy makers on the effect of major infrastructural projects ‚Äì often no more controversial than those in the oil sector. Indeed if a body which represents a petroleum industry could be visibly led by a civil engineer, then we may see decisions not purely driven by money at the (perceived) detriment to the environment. We have to look no further than that National Infrastructure Commission as recently formed in the UK which has as one of their commissioners none other than the current President of the ICE to provide a leading steer.\n\u003e \n\u003e Expert analysis from civil engineers can produce key performance indicators for projects such as embodied CO2¬†or predicted Greenhouse Gas emissions, but the real skill is to generate engineering solutions which create a sustainable balance from the initiation to completion of the project. The sustainability can lie in any of the three pillars of environmental, social and economical, but any intended bias towards one of the three pillars can be closely communicated with policy and decision makers.\n\u003e \n\u003e In the Netherlands one of the most recent and significant offshore gas field discoveries in the mid-1980s showed that the calorific content of the gas was significantly higher than those from previously discovered fields. This created a dilemma for the Dutch Government and engineers at the time. How should the energy infrastructure of the country be managed to meet this new enormous reserve, or vice versa?\n\u003e \n\u003e In balancing the three pillars of sustainability and to help manage the cashflow of the sovereign wealth, civil engineers would have needed to cooperate with petroleum engineers and policy makers needed to have analyse multiple conflicting parameters. What solution generates the lowest gas usage overall? How much more gas is there in the existing reserves? How certain are we of these estimates? How much would it cost to re-fit boilers in every house of the country? How would the answers to all these questions change if the oil or gas price changed significantly?\n\u003e \n\u003e Ultimately, if civil engineers are not in the position of being decision makers for a government, then it is his/her remit to inform, give impartial advice and present a range of suitable solutions with their positive or negative effects . If the civil engineer is in the situation of being a decision maker (such as the National Infrastructure Commission), then in addition to the above duties, there is another equally important job ‚Äì public engagement and communication.\n\u003e \n\u003e # **Altering Public Perception**\n\u003e \n\u003e Extremely tough decisions and sacrifices on multi-billion dollar projects have to be taken once in a while, and the modern trend in communication is that the public media effectively drives a politician‚Äôs re-election. It has a potential to create a conflict of interest such that the politician may be driven by the need to spin sound-bites and media attention, compared to what may be holistically ‚Äòbest‚Äô for a ¬†controversial project such as the development of an oil prospect.\n\u003e \n\u003e Such large scale oil projects has many stages each taking many years. It is fairly common for the timespan from exploration to first oil to last one or two decades. These phases, along with a civil engineer‚Äôs career, is likely to span multiple administrations of governments where they will no doubt have schizophrenically differing agendas and priorities. There is therefore an unintended moral and professional duty to uphold the decisions of their employer, enterprise and governments of the day even if they are conflicting in intent. It should therefore seem sensible that civil engineers must form an integral part of making those decisions and disseminate the information to the wider public to promote healthy two-way feedback.\n\u003e \n\u003e Where engineers commonly fall short is their ability to communicate complex technical ideas to non-technical audiences. Despite communication being a highly valued skill and necessary in nearly every engineering body in the world, the public figureheads of civil engineering (and perhaps engineering in general) are still often seen to be monotonous, intelligent but incommunicable and emotionally stimulated by things which are not necessarily fashionable in the status quo.\n\u003e \n\u003e Oil projects, whose inherent environmental controversy generates news headlines around the world, will for the foreseeable future be subject to many heated arguments and endless scrutiny. Where human emotions start to interfere with the debate, all the required logic and constructive feedback is often rendered futile. Perhaps being naturally risk averse, civil engineers should undertake further training in hostile public encounters to ameliorate such scenarios.\n\u003e \n\u003e Where emotions are driven by mass media, engineers should be able to act as an impartial focal point between journalists and enterprises. This could take the shape of Non-Government Organisations or other legal/charitable entities but the engineer must be free to speak his/her mind without fear of repercussions. Much like how an expert witness is summoned by Court.\n\u003e \n\u003e In recent times ‚Äòsustainability‚Äô and ‚Äòenvironmentally friendly‚Äô have been used by the public interchangeably and synonymously. As hinted at earlier by the three pillars analogy, the layman public should also be well informed of the social and economic considerations of a project too.\n\u003e \n\u003e Where an oil production site may not necessarily create the most environmentally friendly situation in its current form when (in my opinion unfairly) compared to other ‚Äògreen‚Äô projects, the vast economic benefits from tax and royalty revenues as well as the social benefits of creating regional employment and training several generations of skilled labour may lead to more projects where the environmental effects aggregated over these many projects can lead to a net positive environmental result. Civil engineers will need to keep urging the public to see the bigger picture around them.\n\u003e \n\u003e Since the ICE and numerous other engineering bodies started its public campaigns such as those which encourage school children, minority demographics or women into STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) there has been a greater public awareness and celebration of engineering. A few decades ago there may not have been many people who knew many of the technological titans of past and present. Alan Turing, Marie Curie, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Bill Gates. In recent times the Royal Academy of Engineering has two oil/gas industry seniors as their President ‚Äì Denis Rooke and John Browne.\n\u003e \n\u003e # **Conclusion**\n\u003e \n\u003e The key areas that civil engineers will need to improve upon are the collaboration with policy and decision makers, and to interact more with the wider public about all the pillars of sustainable development.\n\u003e \n\u003e While the oil industry can still suffer from an image of environmental chaos, with the rise of user-generated mass media and international government collaborations such as the recent Paris summit, there has never been a better opportunity for civil engineers working in the petroleum industry to create public awareness and debate of the benefits or disadvantages of their work.\n\n_Tim discusses the essay further‚Ä¶_\n\nWhen I finished writing this and read it through, I knew it would be fine ‚Äì it certainly meets the ‚Äútidy first draft‚Äù requirement that ICE use as their passing standard. As confident as it sounds, professional engineers (even students) need to get into the habit of checking their work as they go along. I timed myself and kept to the 2 hours as mandated by ICE. My approximate breakdown of timing was as follows:\n\n-   Planning and structure ‚Äì 20 mins\n-   Writing the essay ‚Äì 1hr 35 mins\n-   Checking ‚Äì 5 mins.\n\nI will be the first to admit that the essay has areas of improvement, but as a passing standard for CEng it is sufficient. With about 15 minutes to go, I had not even started writing my conclusion, so I had to make the trade off and accept that the conclusion would be a bit rough if I were to have enough time to proof-read the rest.¬†Due to the shortage of time, I could only check for obvious spelling and grammatical mistakes, and leaving off anything which requires re-phrasing a sentence. Hence a couple of sentences do sound clumsy, but that is the difference between ‚ÄúA tidy first draft‚Äù and ‚Äúready for publication‚Äù.\n\nI would have liked least 10 to 15 minutes for proof reading, so those extra minutes need to be subtracted from somewhere like the planning, for which large portions can be prepared at home before you arrive for your Written Exercise. (Obviously you will not know the question in advance, but you can prepare lots of useful information ahead).\n\n## **Things you should try to take forward to your review**\n\nYou will note that the Introduction starts off with a narrative feel. This is a nice way to set the tone, and lead the reader into the rest of the essay. I chose one of the most recent oil disasters as something to remind the reader of our collective obligation to society. The last paragraph describes my working position and therefore any stance or bias for the rest of the essay. You could probably imagine if Greenpeace or someone who was not an engineer wrote this, then the arguments put forward would be different.\n\nI decided to use broad headings to allow my argument to develop within. For things like a technical report I might use more rigid sub-headings, but this exercise is meant to act as a creative or expressive piece of writing, so broader headings it was. You will also note that on several occasions I have¬†**expressed my opinion**¬†which is¬†**critical**¬†to passing. As a candidate for CEng level you will need to demonstrate your capacity to lead the industry, which in the case of an essay which has ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù in its title, will mean giving your personal opinion. Sometimes candidates fear that this will work against them if the examiner does not like it, but it is the opposite that is true.¬†**You will only be marked down if your opinion is not supported by well-reasoned logic or evidence.**¬†The examiner cannot fail you for disagreeing with your opinion alone.\n\nYou should also note I have dropped in several references to demonstrate breadth of knowledge and reading outside my work. This is expected of all candidates and forms part of¬†[7. Professional Commitment](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Professional%20Review%20MOC/7.%20Professional%20Commitment.md) and your Continuous Professional Development. You will not have time to do a proper references table system at the end, so you should just mention them in the body of the text as you go along.\n\n**Things to improve**\n\nObviously the conclusion is short and somewhat abrupt. As explained, I did not have enough time to write more. What would I have done if I had the time? I may have continued the Macondo Well story from the introduction in a similar narrative style. Alternatively I may have invented a new short story on the same theme, something along the lines of:\n\n\u003e It is now the year 2030 and Sarah Jones is receiving her degree certificate on stage in front of hundreds of applauding parents.¬†The Chancellor warmly congratulates her for a brilliant degree classification ‚Äì First Class Masters of Civil Engineering ‚Äì and everyone settles to hear valedictorian speech. Three hours after the event, the truth is not many remember what she has said, except for the nugget of information that inspired her into the industry.\n\u003e \n\u003e As a little girl at a weekend government-sponsored STEM event she had learned about the Macondo Well incident and had felt so disgusted by its aftermath that she had been compelled to dedicate her career to the betterment of society and civil engineering. Many of the parents, also civil engineers, attending empathised with her. They too were graduates around the time of the 2010 incident and had felt a sense of pride that their efforts to communicate to the next generation were bearing fruits of their labour.\n\n‚Ä¶and then continued on with the original conclusion (with some minor modifications) from the original essay.\n\n## **Quality Check**\n\nTo be extra sure of my thoughts, I sought feedback from¬†[Mike Rogers](https://thecivilengineeringexam.com/introduction/about-us/)¬†to confirm my thoughts. Here are some of his comments\n\n\u003e In my view an acceptable Written Exercise at the CEng level\n\u003e \n\u003e -   A well presented WE with a clear layout and structure\n\u003e -   A good introduction and good links to personal role as well as the global challenges\n\u003e -   Good to see a discussion with points of view being made\n\u003e -   The WE was an interesting read and contained some good references\n\u003e \n\u003e Just a minor point and very minor in reality, the conclusion could have been a little stronger in pulling the threads together but this is not a big concern.\n\nAs you can see, the feedback is in line with what I expected.\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nThis page has presented a whole Written Exercise submission to the level of CEng and discussions on strong points and possible improvements. You should keep practising writing essays, especially if English is not your first language or if writing does not come naturally to you. Just remember that a ‚Äútidy first draft‚Äù will probably contain an occasional grammatical mistake, but presents all the key arguments that you put forward in a logical and fluid manner.\n\n\n\n\nNavigation: [Homepage](_index.md), [Civil Engineering MOC](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC.md), [Areas MOC](Areas%20MOC)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/Communication-Task-Topics-and-Response-Formats":{"title":"","content":"# Communication Task Topics and Response Formats\nAs taken from the [ICE guidance](https://myice.ice.org.uk/getattachment/364ff1ee-d8fc-46d2-864a-7c4f85d8f914/attachment.aspx), the following topics and responses can be mixed-and-matched in order to make up the [Communication Task](notes/Communication%20Task.md) question. \n\n## Topics\n*Climate*\n - [Decarbonisation](notes/Decarbonisation and climate impacts.md)\n - [Climate impacts](notes/Decarbonisation and climate impacts.md)\n*Infrastructure*\n - [Infrastructure](notes/Infrastructure.md)\n - [Transport and connectivity](notes/Infrastructure.md)\n - [Water and sanitation](notes/Infrastructure.md)\n - [Energy supply](notes/Infrastructure.md)\n*Assets*\n - [Assets in civil engineering](notes/Assets%20in%20civil%20engineering.md)\n - [Security of assets](notes/Assets%20in%20civil%20engineering.md)\n*Technology*\n - [Productivity and technology in civil engineering](notes/Productivity%20and%20technology%20in%20civil%20engineering.md)\n - [Digital and data](notes/Productivity%20and%20technology%20in%20civil%20engineering.md)\n - [Emerging technologies](notes/Productivity%20and%20technology%20in%20civil%20engineering.md)\n*Social*\n - [Future of civil engineering](notes/Future%20of%20civil%20engineering.md)\n - [Education and skills shortage](notes/Education%20and%20skills%20shortage.md)\n\n## Response formats\n\n1) You have been asked to write a piece by a journalist for inclusion in an industry supplement - [Journalist Piece](notes/Journalist%20Piece.md)\n2) You have been asked to write a summary note to inform civil engineering students at your local university undertaking a piece of coursework - [Summary Note](notes/Summary%20Note.md)\n3) Write a letter to a local resident group explaining how these issues will affect them - [Letter to Residents](notes/Letter%20to%20Residents.md)\n4) Write a blog for people with a technical background but without specialist knowledge in civil engineering - [Blog Piece](notes/Blog%20Piece.md)\n5) Write to students in your local secondary school explaining the main issues involved - [Write to Secondary School](notes/Write%20to%20Secondary%20School.md)\n6) Write a briefing note to your local government representative outlining the main points - [Briefing Note](notes/Briefing%20Note.md)\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/Compensation-Event-CE":{"title":"Compensation Event (CE)","content":"# Compensation Event (CE)\nA compensation event is a reassessment of cost or the allocated time to complete a task due to events outside the control of the Subcontractor.

I went to Turkey and started collecting little metal cars, organising them and sorting them into collections.\n\nThere was nothing that brought me more joy as a 10 year old than collecting every individual character in Lego Star Wars and see the little grid of characters slowly fill up.\n\n![image|350](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220721150830.png)\n*Lego Star Wars character grid - gotta collect them all!*\n\nI think this mentality followed me through university and into work; I started collecting fragments of information and building them into an easily sort-able, searchable system which can become greater than the sum of its parts. I make individual standard solutions for design problems and stitch them together piecemeal to solve problems. I record notes of workshops and courses, picking out the most important parts and summarising them in my own words.\n\nI believe this is why I have such an affinity with a notes-taking application called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian allows you to create as many individual notes as you want and link them together; similar to synapses in the brain. I can span any topic and find links between them; whether that be an interesting point in a film which links to a book I read a few years ago, or a method of analysing a concrete slab, the principles of which link to an element of geotechnical design. Also, my regular memory truly is awful, so being able to offload information frees up my mental clarity.\n\n\n![image|400](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220721151712.png)\n*me trying to explain linking notes*\n\n---\n## The architect, the gardener and the librarian\nThis matches my way of thinking as a \"gardener\". There are three types of note-taker as per this [article from Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app#:~:text=Notion.,track%20your%20tasks%2C%20and%20more.).\n\n\u003e -   **The architect.**¬†They enjoy planning, designing processes and frameworks, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily structure their ideas.\n\u003e -   **The gardener.**¬†They enjoy exploring, connecting various thoughts together, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily grow their ideas.\n\u003e -   **The librarian.**¬†They enjoy collecting, building a catalogue of resources, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily retrieve their ideas.\n\nAfter a few years of building a system for myself in the [Civil Engineering](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC.md) field while gaining experience as a Highways Engineer and starting a design placement, I was able to sign off my [ICE Training Agreement](notes/ICE%20Training%20Agreement.md) and start preparing for my [Professional Review](notes/Professional%20Review%20MOC.md). My Obsidian system grew and grew as I collated my experience and knowledge into one [Professional Report](notes/Professional%20Report.md). At this time, I found a way to publish and share these notes. \n\nAfter all, the best way to learn and remember is to teach others.\n\n---\n## The civil engineering garden\nThe [Civil Engineering Garden](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC.md) is the output of this process; a simple to read and understand distillation of my knowledge in civil engineering and other [areas](notes/Areas%20MOC.md). It will be constantly changing, evolving and updating as my own knowledge increases. In places it will be freeform, messy and unfinished; however this is meant to be my own way of remembering things. Notes are never truly finished, never capture everything to know on a topic. They evolve and grow...\n\n...a little bit like a garden.\n\n---\nIf you are reading this, then you are along for the ride as well.\n\nHappy reading, and I really encourage you to start building a system like this yourself! It genuinely changed my life.\n\nIf you want a simple run through of the second brain system and a blueprint of how to create something for yourself, then I recommend the book [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/).\nby [Tiago Forte](People/Tiago%20Forte.md). \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/Digital-Garden-Philosophy-Dans-MacBook-Pro":{"title":"Digital Garden Philosophy","content":"# Digital Garden Philosophy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/Digital-and-data":{"title":"Digital and data","content":"# Digital and data\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/Domestic-client":{"title":"Domestic client","content":"# Domestic client\n\u003e The domestic client is different to the [Commercial client](notes/Commercial%20client.md) in that the client is not part of any business, and is not taking on the construction work as part of their business.\n\nUsually, the following duties pass to these following parties:\n\n-   the¬†[contractor](notes/Contractor.md), if it is a single contractor project, who must take on the legal duties of the client in addition to their own as contractor.

That is what I am doing today!\n### Decide when to fail\nIntentionally fail certain tasks if it requires too much work or time. Decide what can survive on the bare-minimum. What is your highest priority?\n### Limit our work in progress\nUse an open and closed to do list. Write down everything open on one side, and choose a maximum of 3-5 things on the closed list which has to be completed. This is just a quick way to prioritise what you have to complete.\n### Serialise, serialise, serialise\nChoose one big project to focus on at once.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/Future-of-civil-engineering":{"title":"Future of civil engineering","content":"# Future of civil engineering\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-1-No-Poverty":{"title":"GOAL 1 No Poverty(httpswww.un.orgdevelopmentdesadisabilitiespage_id=6226\u0026preview=true)","content":"# GOAL 1 No Poverty(httpswww.un.orgdevelopmentdesadisabilitiespage_id=6226\u0026preview=true)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-10-Reduced-Inequality":{"title":"GOAL 10 Reduced Inequality","content":"# GOAL 10 Reduced Inequality\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-11-Sustainable-Cities-and-Communities":{"title":"GOAL 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities","content":"# GOAL 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-12-Responsible-Consumption-and-Production":{"title":"GOAL 12 Responsible Consumption and Production","content":"# GOAL 12 Responsible Consumption and Production\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-13-Climate-Action":{"title":"GOAL 13 Climate Action","content":"# GOAL 13 Climate Action\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-14-Life-Below-Water":{"title":"GOAL 14 Life Below Water","content":"# GOAL 14 Life Below Water\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-15-Life-on-Land":{"title":"GOAL 15 Life on Land","content":"# GOAL 15 Life on Land\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-16-Peace-and-Justice-Strong-Institutions":{"title":"GOAL 16 Peace and Justice Strong Institutions","content":"# GOAL 16 Peace and Justice Strong Institutions\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-17-Partnerships-to-achieve-the-Goal":{"title":"GOAL 17¬†Partnerships to achieve the Goal","content":"# GOAL 17¬†Partnerships to achieve the Goal\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-2-Zero-Hunger":{"title":"GOAL 2 Zero Hunger","content":"# GOAL 2 Zero Hunger\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-3-Good-Health-and-Well-being":{"title":"GOAL 3 Good Health and Well-being","content":"# GOAL 3 Good Health and Well-being\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-4-Quality-Education":{"title":"GOAL 4 Quality Education","content":"# GOAL 4 Quality Education\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-5-Gender-Equality":{"title":"GOAL 5 Gender Equality","content":"# GOAL 5 Gender Equality\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-6-Clean-Water-and-Sanitation":{"title":"GOAL 6 Clean Water and Sanitation","content":"# GOAL 6 Clean Water and Sanitation\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-7-Affordable-and-Clean-Energy":{"title":"GOAL 7 Affordable and Clean Energy","content":"# GOAL 7 Affordable and Clean Energy\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-8-Decent-Work-and-Economic-Growth":{"title":"GOAL 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth","content":"# GOAL 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/GOAL-9-Industry-Innovation-and-Infrastructure":{"title":"GOAL 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure","content":"# GOAL 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.730290126Z","tags":null},"/notes/Galliford-Try-Net-Zero-2030":{"title":"Galliford Try Net Zero 2030","content":"# Galliford Try Net Zero 2030\n\nGalliford Try is addressing the climate emergency by committing to Net Zero carbon across it's own operations by 2030, and Net Zero across all activities by 2045.

Easy to understand and gives the fundamentals. The main areas of [[Philosophy]] are: [[Deontology]], which boils down to everyone should follow a clear set of rules which define whether an action is good or bad. [[Moral Theory]], and subsequent [[Utilitarianism]]  from [Immanuel Kant](notes/Immanuel%20Kant.md) denotes that the best thing to do is the thing that creates the most tangible benefit, in terms of quantity. In the trolley problem, this would be that the 5 people should be saved as this has the greatest intrinsic output. The difference between [[Moral Theory]] and [[Utilitarianism]] is that the latter considers the output to be happiness, rather than moral worth. Expand the research and understanding of [[Virtue Ethics]] and the other definitions in your spare time. \n\nThe big takeaway are essentially two quotes, which Schur instills into his own children in a touching send-off to the book. \n\n\u003e ‚ÄúThousands of years ago, in a part of Greece called Delphi, some people built a temple. They were worried about their kids too‚Äîall parents in history have been worried about their kids, it‚Äôs not just Mom and me‚Äîso they chiseled a couple of sayings into a column of that temple to tell their kids, and their grandkids, and their great-grandkids, in as few words as possible, how to try to pull off the nearly impossible task of living a good life on earth. Here‚Äôs what they wrote:\n\u003e \n\u003e **Know thyself.**\n\u003e \n\u003e and\n\u003e \n\u003e **Nothing in excess.**\n\u003e \n\u003e Honestly, as far as ‚Äúguides to life‚Äù go, I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs beaten that in the 2,400 years since.

Nothing in excess‚Äîbecause too much (or too little) of anything will screw you up. Practice virtues like kindness and generosity and courage, but not too much of them. Drink whiskey, when you‚Äôre old enough, but don‚Äôt drink too much whiskey. (Single malt, by the way. None of that blended junk.) Watch TV, but don‚Äôt watch too much TV. Don‚Äôt eat too many tacos, or exercise too much, or curse too much (I struggle with that one).

There isn't an unlimited supply of these mateirals.\n2) Cost of exploitation and production - there are a number of costs not initially visible in regards to energy supply, such as wages of the miners. Some resources are too expensive to relinquish from the ground, for example the UK has goal reserves that it is not feasible to mine. \n3) Technology - solar panels, wind turbines and gas extraction are new technologies that can be brought in.\n4) Political factors - war can destroy energy resources, corruption and lack of funding can all contribute.\n[The Big Debate 2016 - the UK energy industry is not fit for purpose - ICE Lecture](https://www.ice.org.uk/events/past-events-and-recordings/recorded-lectures/the-big-debate-2016-this-house-believes-that-the-uk-energy-industry-is-not-fit-for-purpose-to-secure-a-low-carbon-energy-supply-london/)\n[Factors affecting energy availability - BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zxc2sg8/revision/2)\n[The energy policy 'Trilemma' - ICE 2015](https://www.ice.org.uk/engineering-resources/briefing-sheets/the-energy-policy-trilemma/)\n\n#### Infrastructure Resilience\nInfrastructure resilience can be [defined as](https://www.gov.uk/research-for-development-outputs/introducing-infrastructure-resilience) \"the robustness of a structure to withstand hazards\". This can be influenced through the adherence to appropriate engineering standards, with increased safety factors and appropriate detail. \nIt is important to consider that appropriate codes and guidance may not reflect the upcoming climatic uncertainties. The challenge, referred to as the 'Trilemma' by the ICE for adoption and sustainability in regards to energy supply is:\n1) Decarbonisation - carbon and other GHG emissions from energy supply and use must be reduced in order to reduce climate change impacts. \n2) Security of supply - an adequate security of energy supply must be maintained, including resilience to both short-term and long-term challenges.\n3) Cost - the cost of energy must be affordable for consumers.\n\nCivil engineers can contribute to the Trilemma in the following ways:\n - Constructing new energy infrastructure, including low carbon electricity generation and electricity transmission\n - Integrating energy efficiency measures into all aspects of the built environment\n - Innovating to deliver cost reductions in delivering decarbonised energy and increasing resilience\n - Controlling and limiting all potential impacts of energy infrastructure on the environment (climate change, but also air, water and land)\n - Using low carbon materials and methods for construction\n - Providing the knowledge, skills and people to make low carbon energy a reality\n - Advising on policy frameworks required for investor confidence and promote a stable, long-term vision for supply while retaining flexibility and market signals in delivery.\n\n[ICE - Climate change resilience - Webinar](http://www.ice.org.uk/eventarchive/climate-change-resilience-infrastructure-webinar)\n[Gov - Introducing Infrastructure Resilience](http://www.gov.uk/research-for-development-outputs/introducing-infrastructure-resilience)\n[G20 - Building resilient infrastructure systems](http://www.g20-insights.org/policy_briefs/building-resilient-infrastructure-systems/)\n\n#### Transport Connectivity\nTransport connectivity can relate to the ease at which individuals and vehicles can access different parts of the country. This is important to ensure people have the capacity to trade, travel and do business, regardless of their location in the country. Generally, the UK is a good place to live in regards to travel connectivity. \n\nThe ICE conducted a survey in which the public were asked which travel improvements they would like to see. The top answers were:\n\n1) Cheaper cost of travel\n2) Faster journey time\n3) More direct journeys\n\nIt is important to ensure any investment can affect and not marginalise certain groups of people. For example, Glasgow has received a high amount of infrastructure investment in it's public transport systems. While cars have been prioritised with new roads, the level of bus transport has dropped and had less investment, meaning those that do not live close to a train station or own a car are a bit left behind.\n[ICE - Response to union connectivity review](http://www.ice.org.uk/news-and-insight/policy/ice-response-to-the-union-connectivity-review)\n[ICE - Creative an inclusive, thriving, liveable city](http://www.ice.org.uk/eventarchive/creating-inclusive-thriving-liveable-city-glasgow)\n[NIC - Transport connectivity report](https://nic.org.uk/app/uploads/NIC-Transport-Connectivity-1-Final-Report.pdf)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.734290128Z","tags":null},"/notes/Institution-of-Civil-Engineers":{"title":"Institution of Civil Engineers","content":"# Institution of Civil Engineers\nThe [Institution of Civil Engineers](notes/Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers.md) is the leading professional engineering body and charitable body for civil engineering. \n\nüë®‚Äçüíº **Current President** - [Ed McCann](People/Ed%20McCann.md)\nüôç‚Äç‚ôÇ **Upcoming President** - [Keith Howells](notes/Keith%20Howells.md)\n\nAll trainees going for their [Professional Review](notes/Professional%20Review%20MOC.md) must know the [ICE Code of Conduct](notes/ICE%20Code%20of%20Conduct.md) in order to demonstrate [Professional Commitment](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Professional%20Review%20MOC/7.%20Professional%20Commitment.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.734290128Z","tags":null},"/notes/Journalist-Piece":{"title":"Journalist Piece","content":"# Journalist Piece\nI believe a journalist piece should be informative but almost from the perspective of someone going in without knowing something.

The key underpinning of this is something considered in [Atomic Habits - James Clear (2018)](notes/Atomic%20Habits%20-%20James%20Clear%20(2018).md); make every action as simple and as pain-free as possible.\n\n#### take an inventory\nBefore thinking about how you can change your life, you need to know your starting point. Harvey recommends completing a brain dump, or a full and honest analysis of your current life and affairs. For example:\n - What is your relationship with your body? How is your mental health?\n - Are you happy in your job?\n - How are your finances? Are you already investing or are you a serial spender?\n - How do you feel about your immediate environment?\nThis questions can be applied along with other questions around relationships and your desire for new challenges. I believe that this should not be a one-time activity, but rather a continuous assessment and reflection about your current state and desires.\n\n\u003e Rather than only listing things you are currently unhappy about, try to include some new and exciting possibilities as well.\n\n### change for the better\nThe remainder of the book following this initial setup process is a deep dive into the cornerstones of life; examine your state and apply small steps to seamlessly guide your life towards a better place. The following are some standout \"Kaizen Steps\" from each of these areas. Note that some of these are short-term and long-term goals.\n\n#### Health\nHealth and diet are a real focus for me at the moment, with a strong approach to be more disciplined in controlling and monitoring my health and diet.\n - *Find an unusual way to exercise* - Despite the general male pressure to be a certain type of 'fit', I can never find motivation to go exclusively to the gym. This helped me realise that my favoured routine of american football and soccer is good enough. This also applies to another approach - *Remember that walking, shopping and dancing all count!* **Kaizen Step** - research a class and plan your outfit to wear for it.\n\n#### Diet\n - *Link your water consumption to another moment in your day* - I now drink a pint of water while waiting for the kettle to boil for my morning coffee.\n - *Use fruit to sweeten items instead of raw sugar* - using a bit of nice raspberry jam makes me feel a little bit better about getting my morning sweet hit.\n - *Measure your food* - I was always a \"grab a handful of pasta\" kind-of-person but now, keeping the kitchen scales by the hob makes me slightly more inclined to actually measure them out.\n\n#### Sleep\nSimilarly above, being more mindful and disciplined with my sleep and wake times is slowly having a positive effect on my life.\n - *Declutter your room* - it is so easy to keep yesterday's clothes on the floor but putting them away and getting tomorrow's clothes out, nice and steamed makes me a lot more settled in the evening.\n - *Surround yourself with nice smells* - reed diffusers have become a bit of an obsession recently.\n\n#### Work\n - *Invest in some plants* - I am the only one in my design office that have any plants around my desk - they make a difference!\n - *Do a little bit every day* - while trying to develop a writing habit, I am aiming to wake up a little earlier each day to complete a small amount of writing. I hope to improve my typing speed and be a little less precious about the output!\n\n#### Money\n - *Leave the item for 24 hours* - this is a sentiment I have heard across a number of similar books but by adding an item to your basket and returning the next day, you are much less likely to require it.\n - *Change the environments that make you want to spend* - adding Amazon to a blocked-list for example stops mindless scrolling, and finding a version of Instagram that hides ads also helps.\n\n#### Home\nI am already a keen home-minimalist, and one of my favourite activities at home is to tidy and clean. I find it therapeutic and satisfying to organise my most inhabited spaces. Harvey makes a case for opting to keep and repair older items, trying to cut down on today's rampant consumerism.\n - *Mend holes, broken zips and rips*, *Recycle, recycle, recycle* and *Sell, sell, sell!* all adhere to this.\n\n#### Relationships\nIn today's world, I find it harder and harder to find things in common with people, and trying to build rapport is a challenge for a relative introvert like myself. Reading this reminded me however that quality over quantity should always be strived for.\n - *Let your loved ones know how important they are to you* - I have made a much more concerted effort to show appreciation and gratitude to those that mean a lot to me. It makes me feel better when I hear the same, so why should I reserve affection to my partner and friends?\n - *Celebrate your independence* - something which has held be back from making deeper connections has been a reservation to display my interests and likes. In most cases, I just like hearing from people that are passionate about something, so I should be less afraid to be open and honest! This may help me *find my tribe*, as Harvey also writes about.\n\n### fail upwards\nIncorporating Kaizen steps into your daily life is not a straight-forward task, however it is this continuous improvement that means that if you do stumble, you are most likely ahead of where you started. Seek support from others, build accountability for yourself, and foster a link to your community to help you along this path.\n\n### who would I recommend this book to?\nAnyone who is looking for a quick-start guide to improvement, or someone who is looking for new ideas to start.\n\n### if you liked this...\nI would recommend the obvious comparison of [Atomic Habits - James Clear (2018)](notes/Atomic%20Habits%20-%20James%20Clear%20(2018).md), for a deeper dive into how to proactively build these habits into your daily routine, and [Wabi Sabi - Beth Kempton (2018)](notes/Wabi%20Sabi%20-%20Beth%20Kempton%20(2018).md) for a further celebration of Japanese culture.\n\n\n\n\nSome resonant \"Kaizen Steps\" I took away from this were:\n\n#### Health\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.734290128Z","tags":null},"/notes/Keith-Howells":{"title":"Keith Howells","content":"# Keith Howells\n\nKeith Howells is the 2022 ICE President, the 158th to hold the position.\n\n\u003e An ICE fellow, Keith has had a distinguished career in the planning, design and construction of hydraulic structures and river engineering schemes, urban drainage and sewerage, hydropower, and water supply schemes.\n\u003e \n\u003e He was managing director of engineering consultancy firm Mott MacDonald from 2004 to 2011, and chair from 2011-2019.

Each chapter of his life is centered around a particular dish, whether it be his father's simple *\"Eggs with Tomato\"*, or the family's decadent Christmas *\"Timpano\"*: a multi-layered pasta and meat concoction to be slaved over and devoured quickly. In a similar way, I chomped down this book in a matter of days, invested and enveloped in a warm-hearted, starchy embrace, listening to Tucci's stories and being astounded by his passion for sharing and kindness for those around him.\n\n\u003e I must admit that years ago I never thought that my passion and interest in food would come close to eclipsing how I felt about my chosen profession. Acting, directing, cinema, and the theater had always defined me. But after my diagnosis I discovered that eating, drinking, the kitchen, and the table now play those roles. Food not only feeds me, it enriches me. All of me. Mind, body, and soul. It is nothing more than everything.\n\u003e Cook.\n\u003e Smell.\n\u003e Taste.\n\u003e Eat.\n\u003e Drink.\n\u003e Share.\n\u003e Repeat as necessary.\"\n\n## the Mediterranean way\nA main takeaway from this book that I brought into my own life is that food should not be a shameful enjoyment. Myself and my partner love our food and travel long distances to seek out the best (in the UK, Everyday People in Nottingham for the best Japanese fusion food, or Grazie in Sheffield for the freshest pasta). The way in with Tucci regails stories of his past, rooted in the food and people made me truly think how important food is. My fiance is essentially half-Italian and it pains me to say that the tradition of eating round a large table with fresh food has slipped slightly, especially through the dreaded pandemic. This book inspired me to seek out fresher ingredients and cook simply, infusing time and love into the most basic of dishes. To try and focus on the task at hand away from distraction.\n\n## simplicity\nI found the sections around family and sharing the most resonant in the book. Tucci spends far more time on this than simply describing his ascension through the acting world. One theme that stuck out particularly was [[tradition]] and [[legacy]]. The fact that the ideals and opinions of our ancestors travel down the branches of family; evident in the lengthy tangents about which pasta shapes suit which sauces, and the tradition of serving particular dishes at celebrations. You can hear Tucci's passion for this when hearing of the encouragement he gives to his own children. This has made me seek out and question my own families traditions; to seek stories which may help me understand them on a deeper level.\n\n\u003e People often wonder why, if there is such a huge first course, there is even a need for a second course at all. I have no answer for them. All I know is that it is traditional. It is very rare that one eats in an Italian home and both a *primo* and *secondo* are not served on any given day.\n\n## who would I recommend this book to?\nIf you are driving a long distance, or want a book to remind you of the importance of [[Slow Living]], then this is perfect.\n\n\n## if you liked this...\nI feel like [[Storyworthy - Matthew Dicks (2018)]] may be a recommendation along with any other book, but this stands out as an obvious companion.","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.734290128Z","tags":null},"/notes/Temporary-Works":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.734290128Z","tags":null},"/notes/Temporary-Works-MOC":{"title":"üîß Temporary Works MOC","content":"# Temporary Works MOC\n\u003e \"Temporary works can be described as providing an \"engineered solution\" that is used to support or protect either an existing structure or the permanent works during construction, or to support an item of plant or equipment, or the vertical sides or side-slopes of an excavation during construction operations on site or to provide access.

The Rio +20 outcome also contained other measures for implementing sustainable development, including mandates for future programmes of work in development financing, small island developing states and more.\n-   In 2013, the General Assembly set up a 30-member¬†[Open Working Group](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/owg)¬†to develop a proposal on the SDGs.\n-   In January 2015, the General Assembly began the negotiation process on the¬†[post-2015 development agenda](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/negotiations). The process culminated in the subsequent adoption of the¬†[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld), with¬†[17 SDGs](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs)¬†at its core, at the¬†[UN Sustainable Development Summit](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/summit)¬†in September 2015.\n-   2015 was a landmark year for multilateralism and international policy shaping, with the adoption of several major agreements:\n    -   [Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/frameworks/sendaiframework)¬†(March 2015)\n    -   [Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/frameworks/addisababaactionagenda)¬†(July 2015)\n    -   [Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda)¬†with its 17 SDGs was adopted at the¬†[UN Sustainable Development Summit](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/summit)¬†in New York in September 2015.\n    -   [Paris Agreement on Climate Change](https://sdgs.un.org/frameworks/parisagreement)¬†(December 2015)\n-   Now, the annual¬†[High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/hlpf)¬†serves as the central UN platform for the follow-up and review of the SDGs.\n\nToday, the¬†[Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG)](https://sdgs.un.org/about)¬†in the United Nations¬†[Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/)¬†provides substantive support and capacity-building for the SDGs and their related thematic issues, including¬†[water](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/water-and-sanitation),¬†[energy](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/energy),¬†[climate](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/climate-change),¬†[oceans](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/oceans-and-seas),¬†[urbanization](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/sustainable-cities-and-human-settlements),¬†[transport](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/sustainable-transport),¬†[science and technology](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/science), the¬†[Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR)](https://sdgs.un.org/gsdr),¬†[partnerships](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdinaction)¬†and¬†[Small Island Developing States](https://sdgs.un.org/topics/small-island-developing-states). DSDG plays a key role in the evaluation of UN systemwide implementation of the 2030 Agenda and on advocacy and outreach activities relating to the SDGs. In order to make the 2030 Agenda a reality, broad ownership of the SDGs must translate into a strong commitment by all stakeholders to implement the global goals. DSDG aims to help facilitate this engagement.","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.734290128Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-Work-at-Height-Regulations-2005":{"title":"The Work at Height Regulations (2005)","content":"# The Work at Height Regulations (2005)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.734290128Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-history-of-temporary-works":{"title":"The history of temporary works","content":"# The history of temporary works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.734290128Z","tags":null},"/notes/Tough-Terry-Crews-2022":{"title":"Tough - Terry Crews (2022)","content":"# Tough\n## [[Terry Crews]]\n## 2022\nURL: [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/search?qid=\u0026q=9780593329818)\n##### Status:: #Finished\n##### Rating:: 2.5\n###### Genres: [[Self-Improvement]], [[Discipline]], [[Family]]\n###### #content/book \n\n![image|100](https://books.google.com/books/content?id=cqw5EAAAQBAJ\u0026printsec=frontcover\u0026img=1\u0026zoom=1\u0026edge=curl\u0026source=gbs_api)\n\n# Mental Model\n---\nMM:: Terry Crews recounts his life from being a young, abused boy watching his parents be either alcoholics or being pressured into a Christian cult, going through the NFL into his acting career and draws life lessons to give to the reader.

I think I found that he got successful, learnt his inner power, but maybe missed on actionable things or specific ways in which he helped people.

The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question.

Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site.

There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:20:11.73829013Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
