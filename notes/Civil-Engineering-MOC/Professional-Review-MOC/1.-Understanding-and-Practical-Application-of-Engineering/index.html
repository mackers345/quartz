Technology and developments in the industry move quickly - therefore it is important to stay in touch with new changes.</p><p>It is important to <mark>know the theory, but more so, know how this is used in your current work</mark>.

Those who construct something need to explain how it was designed and so on. How many tower cranes were needed? What load did they impose? How were the piles installed; what size piling rig was needed? <mark>These things shouldn‚Äôt be assumed to be none of your business.</mark> There is also an overlap with the commercial Attribute, as often there are financial judgements to make, such as a trade-off between capital expenditure now against future operational expenditure.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;The additional obligation for CPR candidates in part 1(g) is to undertake these actions, not merely contribute to them. This provides a different challenge; where the candidate can show that these things were done, this possibly sits neatly with the obligation in part 1(h) to exercise sound independent engineering judgement. <mark>When designing a bridge with a design life of 120 years, how can you do this if you don‚Äôt know what traffic will look like in say 50 years‚Äô time?</mark>&rdquo;</em></p><a href=#h-exercise-sound-independent-engineering-judgement><h6 id=h-exercise-sound-independent-engineering-judgement><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><em>h) exercise sound independent engineering judgement</em></h6></a><p>Using the above as reference, any judgements considering the

But what is the difference between them?</p><p>The A) and B) are about getting your knowledge up to the current industry best practices, while C) and D) are about taking it further. Of course as a CEng applicant you will need to know what the current best practices are before you attempt anything new. Similar to how you would perform a literature review in an academic thesis in the first chapter.</p><p>There is not an expectation to create something totally new, but more appropriately a small amendment in how things were previously done¬†which brings improvement for the industry or the society. For instance:</p><ul><li>Did you amend a concrete pouring sequence to save 2% of total concrete volume, or speed up the process by 3%?</li><li>Did you manage to automate via a computer script a boring but important engineering job to save time for everyone and free up resources?</li><li>Did you do a bit of research behind a building design code and notice some leeway to deviate under certain situations?</li></ul><p>If you studied for a Masters or Doctorate degree then satisfying this Attribute should be fairly straightforward, as the requirements to pass those degrees are in line with what is required here.</p><p>Remember you need to show capability to do the above, so think broadly, even if your evidences are not so relevant to your daily work. For instance, you can demonstrate your eagerness to learn through attending all sorts of courses and conferences, and for CEng ‚Äì applying this newly gained knowledge in your role. You may have helped a friend to design an extension to his house and had to do background research. (Though this last example on its own probably would not get you through a review.)</p><p>Just remember the main things to you will need to demonstrate in your portfolio and review are:</p><ul><li>Curiosity and self-initiative</li><li>Ability to learn by yourself</li><li>Why your new, and old, knowledge is beneficial to engineering</li><li>How you are able to introduce your new idea/technique into industry.
