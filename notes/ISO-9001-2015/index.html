Many of the additional points have been sourced from <em>Essentials: ISO 9001:2015 for Everyday Operations</em> by Martin Hinsch.

It represents a foundation of planning, control and improvement.</p></blockquote><p>The latest revision of ISO 9001 strays away from simply listing a set of requirements, instead converting into a &ldquo;risk-based standard&rdquo;, which allows flexibility and customisation to suit a number of different organisations. The standard describes itself as a &ldquo;
<a href=/quartz/notes/Process-Approach/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/Process-Approach/>Process Approach</a>&rdquo;. Many of the requirements are within the context of your organisation.

<a href=/quartz/notes/Quality-Management-System/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/Quality-Management-System/>Quality Management System</a> is the approach to
<a href=/quartz/notes/Risk/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/Risk/>Risk</a>. Risk is defined as a management task and should be anchored throughout the organisation. Management must ensure that a risk process is established and the risk concept is presented in all processes.

<a href=/quartz/notes/Certification-Audit/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/Certification-Audit/>Certification Audit</a> is the decisive stage to allow a company or organisation to achieve
<a href=/quartz/notes/ISO-9001-2015/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/ISO-9001-2015/>ISO 9001 2015</a> certification. The auditor will study the processes put in place by the organisation and mark the ISO requirements as &ldquo;completed&rdquo; if they are satisfactory.
The key things being looked for are the adoption of a quality culture, as well as the in-house documentation and its use within organisational practice. An audit cycle can take up to three years to complete, and has a
<a href=/quartz/notes/Certification-Audit/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/Certification-Audit/>number of different steps</a>.
The findings can either be successful, or flag up significant or minor nonconformities, or recommendations and improvements.
A surveillance audit takes place twice in the three years following the initial certification.</p><a href=#4-context-of-the-organisation><h2 id=4-context-of-the-organisation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>4.

Identifying and implementing the customer&rsquo;s needs is an essential factor in achieving customer satisfaction. If we think about this in terms of site work, regular progress meetings and systems to share and review documentation is vital to ensure communication of changes and developments is maintained at all points. This could be in the form of a

From a company wide angle, their requirement is to have this process accessible and available; in civil engineering, this is usually in the form of a
