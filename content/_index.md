title: üèó The Engineering Garden

Hi! My name is Dan Mackley and I am a civil engineer, working in the construction industry. This digital garden is a way for me to record and share information for future civil engineers, and act as a way to document my learning!

# Get Started
[[Engineering MOC]]
The engineering Map of Content will guide you through this garden of knowledge!

So in theory by changing this file, the rest should change and the Mac should be able to see this!

It is hard to get the autocommit working! I might have to ask Discord!

$$ S=\int_{x}\left\{\frac{1}{2}\sum_{a}\partial^{\mu}\chi_{a}\partial_{\mu}\chi_{a}+V(\rho)\right\}, $$$$ R/A^{\prime}=\,c^{\vee}\,N_{c}\,B_{c}\,s_{c}\,i_{c}+q^{\prime}\,N_{\mathrm{q}}\,b_{\mathrm{q}}\,s_{\mathrm{q}}\,i_{\mathrm{q}}+0,5\,\,\gamma\,B^{\dagger}N_{7}\,b_{7}\,s_{_{7}}\,i_{7} $$
$$ \frac{R^{\prime}}{A^{\prime}}=\left(\pi+2\right)\,c_{u}\,b_{c}\,s_{c}\,i_{c}+q $$
