title: üèó The Engineering Garden
---

Hi! My name is Dan Mackley and I am a civil engineer, working in the construction industry. This digital garden is a way for me to record and share information for future civil engineers, and act as a way to document my learning!

# Get Started
### How it works
This website contains a number of different pages, including methodologies, definitions, examples and reflections on civil engineering practice and 
The engineering Map of Content will guide you through this garden of knowledge!


$$ S=\int_{x}\left\{\frac{1}{2}\sum_{a}\partial^{\mu}\chi_{a}\partial_{\mu}\chi_{a}+V(\rho)\right\}, $$$$ R/A^{\prime}=\,c^{\vee}\,N_{c}\,B_{c}\,s_{c}\,i_{c}+q^{\prime}\,N_{\mathrm{q}}\,b_{\mathrm{q}}\,s_{\mathrm{q}}\,i_{\mathrm{q}}+0,5\,\,\gamma\,B^{\dagger}N_{7}\,b_{7}\,s_{_{7}}\,i_{7} $$
$$ \frac{R^{\prime}}{A^{\prime}}=\left(\pi+2\right)\,c_{u}\,b_{c}\,s_{c}\,i_{c}+q $$
