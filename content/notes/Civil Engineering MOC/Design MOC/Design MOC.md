# Design MOC
I started completing civil engineering design work as part of a [[Temporary Works]] design team. I am slowly gathering new methods and ways of solving problems, which I will share here for future reference. Below are a set of methods in different areas.

## Geotechnics
[[Calculate bearing capacity of soils]]

## Steel

## Concrete

## Actions on Structures
