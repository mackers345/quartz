# Contract
Every contract essentially boils down to three components, and a contract cannot be legally binding without any of them. These are:

- Offer - goods, services, product or money must be offered. 
- Acceptance - a party mu st provide verbal or written acceptance.
- Monetary Value - an exchange must be present to accept the offer.

There are a few different easy definitions of contracts, one is "the rules of the game", and another is "the allocation of [[risk]]". The choice of which contract is applied to certain work packages entirely depends on the level of risk to be taken on by the Client and the Contractor. This can dictate whether a [[notes/Civil Engineering MOC/Commercial MOC/Priced Contract]] or [[Target Cost]] is applied.

The [[NEC3]] contract, with which I have had the most experience, is broken down into the following key sections:

 - [[Core Clauses]] 
 - Option Clauses ([[Option A Activity Schedule]], [[Option B Bill of Quantities]] etc.)
 - [[W Clauses]] - dispute resolution
 - [[X Clauses]] - ways to implement the recovery and provision of money
 - [[Z Clauses]] - deviations and adjustments to the standard form of contract
