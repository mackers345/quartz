>"Civil engineers design, create and connect up the world around us. They help make our villages, towns and cities work for the people that live there." - *The Institution of Civil Engineering*

My experience covers three main areas; explore below:

 - 🔨 [Site Work MOC](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Site%20Work%20MOC/Site%20Work%20MOC.md)
 - 💻 [Design MOC](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Design%20MOC/Design%20MOC.md)
 - 💵 [Commercial MOC](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Commercial%20MOC/Commercial%20MOC.md)

The cumulation of a civil engineer's journey is becoming a [Chartered Civil Engineer (CEng)](Chartered%20Civil%20Engineer%20(CEng)).
