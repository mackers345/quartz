# Institution of Civil Engineers
The [Institution of Civil Engineers](notes/Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers.md) is the leading professional engineering body and charitable body for civil engineering. 

👨‍💼 **Current President** - [Ed McCann](People/Ed%20McCann.md)
🙍‍♂ **Upcoming President** - [Keith Howells](notes/Keith%20Howells.md)

All trainees going for their [Professional Review](notes/Professional%20Review%20MOC.md) must know the [ICE Code of Conduct](notes/ICE%20Code%20of%20Conduct.md) in order to demonstrate [Professional Commitment](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Professional%20Review%20MOC/7.%20Professional%20Commitment.md).

> The ICE takes a lead role in debates on the environment, green energy, [climate change](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Professional%20Review%20MOC/5.%20Sustainable%20Development.md) and sustainability. The "vision" of the ICE, as disclosed in their own documentation, is to =="Harness the capability and capacity of the global engineering community to accelerate the delivery of the sustainable development goals for the benefit of society. Bring about a transformation in the delivery of infrastructure through leadership, advocacy, nurturing collaboration and building knowledge and skills.==

This emphasis on sustainability has led to a slight shift in focus; instead of "predicting and providing", "targeting and managing" is the key message. In practice, this means maintaining and improving existing assets to sustainable solutions, and expanding this to bigger environmental, social and geographical problems.
