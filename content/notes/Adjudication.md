# Adjudication

>An adjudication is a legal ruling or [judgment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/judgement.asp), usually final, but can also refer to the process of settling a legal case or claim through the court or justice system, such as a decree in the bankruptcy process between the defendant and the [creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp).

Normally, an adjudication represents the final judgment or pronouncement in a case that will determine the course of action taken regarding the issue presented. Outside of a legal process, adjudication can also more generally refer to other formal processes of judgment or ruling that render a final decision, such as the process of validating an [insurance claim](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp).
