# Getting Paid

*Trainer: Geoff White*

Making sure we get paid on time and the right amount. This focuses on general key areas.

## üìî The Construction Act

In the UK, [The Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act (1996)](notes/The%20Housing%20Grants,%20Construction%20and%20Regeneration%20Act%20(1996).md), more commonly referred to as "The Construction Act", is intended to ensure payments are made promptly throughout the supply chain and disputes are resolved swiftly. A key part of this is regular and interim payments - a fair payment regime. In the 80s and 90s, there were occasions where the subcontractors were not getting paid, which led to some good companies going under due to there being a lack of effective cash-flow. Any party involved in the construction process can take another party to [Adjudication](notes/Adjudication.md) at any time.

Certain projects are not included within The Construction Act, such as;

- drilling for the extraction of oil and natural gas
- extraction, tunelling or boring of minerals
- assembly, installation or demolition of plant or machinery, steelwork (to support or provide access to plant or machinery - [Temporary Works](notes/Temporary%20Works%20MOC.md).
- manufacture or delivery of components, plant or machinery
- making, installing and repairing artistic works
- water or effluent treatment - common in temporary works as well.

> The above, "The Old Act" was superseded by "The New Act": the [Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act (2009)](notes/Local%20Democracy,%20Economic%20Development%20and%20Construction%20Act%20(2009).md). This came into force in 2011, so any contract or new job signed after 2011 would be enforceable under the new act.

The latest version of the act requires the giving of:

- a payment notice by the payer
- specifying the amount due and the basis on which the sum is calculation - known as the [Notified Sum](notes/Notified%20Sum.md)
- a payless notice if the payer intends to pay less than the [Notified Sum](notes/Notified%20Sum.md) stated in the payment notice

A payment notice needs to be given within 5 days of the assessment date
A pay less notice not later than 7 days before the final date of payment

==If we don't issue a valid payment notice then their application becomes the notified sum== - no reductions in payment can be issued and the application can be whatever the subcontractor puts.

## üí∞ Value

Value can be defined as:
- the total amount of cash due from the [Client](notes/Commercial%20client.md) for completing the project works
- provision for interim payments is how this tends to work, usually monthly

Some terms that are present in this is:

- Cash flow - the movement of money into and out of a business
- Turnover - the amount of business transacted during a specific period ‚Üí traded
- Value - what we are due

==Cashflow, turnover and value are not the same==

### Optimising Value - [Priced Contract](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Commercial%20MOC/Priced%20Contract.md)
Some general rules to follow to ensure value is optimised when arranging payment to a subcontractor:
- understand the contract and comply with it
- understand the contract you are on - it might not be a standard issue
- ensure that all required Notices are given on time
- understand what can be applied for (applications)
- check if there are [Condition Precedence](notes/Condition%20Precedence.md) to payments
	- for example, how do [Early Warning](notes/Early%20Warning.md)s and [Compensation Event (CE)](notes/Compensation%20Event%20(CE).md)s work, or other similar mechanisms?
- make sure the contract is signed and is the final version

On occasion, there may be changes to the payment. To ensure value is optimised in this case, we need to:
- early identification of variations / [Compensation Event (CE)](notes/Compensation%20Event%20(CE).md)
- apply for variations / [Compensation Event (CE)](notes/Compensation%20Event%20(CE).md)s on time (not required if [Target Cost](notes/Target%20Cost.md)).
- provide full substantiation to enable full payment
- request the [Client](notes/Commercial%20client.md)'s representative discusses with you the application prior to certification
- where possible agree the effect of change in advance of certification

When the certified payment certificate comes through, perform the following checks:
- check for mathematical errors - if found, ask for them to be corrected
- understand the contention
- resolve the contention as soon as possible


### Optimising Value - [Target Cost](notes/Target%20Cost.md)
- set up the cost coding so people know which payment is for which activity
- ensure records are kept
- agree the audit regime
- agree disallowed costs as you go
- get the project manager to agree subcontractor final accounts
- correct defects before completion

There are some common pitfalls and stumbling blocks within target cost contracts:
- complacency - if the above is not considered, the cost can start to exceed the budget.
- the client's budget can come under pressure
- the project manager may challenge the disallowed costs in the past; records are important to ensure the process has been followed
- external audits from the client might be provoked and the past records analysed

## üïê Getting Paid on Time
Forecasting and reporting of cash is vital for any business to survive.
Good cash management provides confidence and enables informed decisions to be made.
It is important to understand the payment cycle and ==what needs to be done, when, and by whom==.

### Interim Valuations - Timings
- establish agreed assessment dates at the start of the project with the [Client](notes/Commercial%20client.md)'s representative
- prepare and submit applications in accordance with the contract terms
- value applications to the assessment date even if submitted in advance
- engage with the client's representative

### Cash Management
- good practice to establish a 'point of contact' from the paying party to establish invoicing requirements and provide updates. This is more important for large applications, so a verification process can be undertaken and all stakeholders are informed and involved.
- maintain a payment tracker to know each process and it's position in the cycle
- ensure the appropriate payment certificate is issued promptly and in accordance with the dates in eh [Contract](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Commercial%20MOC/Contract.md). 
- If the certificate is late, make the relevant enquiries and advise your commercial manager.
- issue invoices promptly and ensure the 'payment date' is in accordance with the [Contract](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Commercial%20MOC/Contract.md).

If the payment is late:
- immediately advise your commercial manager
- seek advice regarding the inclusion of interest charges in the next valuation
- understand why this occurred and what needs to be done to prevent it again
