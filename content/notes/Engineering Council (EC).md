# Engineering Council (EC)

>The engineering council (EC) regulates the basic qualifications of all UK professional engineers. It ==sets out benchmark standards for their **academic education** and requirements== for three registration categories: [Incorporated Engineer (IEng)](notes/Incorporated%20Engineer%20(IEng).md), [Chartered Engineer (CEng)](notes/Chartered%20Engineer%20(CEng).md) and EngTech.

These requirements are set out in [The UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence and Commitment (UK Spec) (2020)](https://www.engc.org.uk/media/3417/uk-spec-fourth-edition.pdf). For IEng, a bachelors degree is required, whereas CEng needs a masters or a doctorate.

Within this framework, nominated engineering institutions (within which the [Institution of Civil Engineers](notes/Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers.md) sits) can set their own qualification requirements, but can also offer the letters designated by the [Engineering Council (EC)](notes/Engineering%20Council%20(EC).md). 

==To be a [Chartered Engineer (CEng)](notes/Chartered%20Engineer%20(CEng).md), it is important to understand the wider aspects of our profession and the involvement of your employer in the whole industry.==

The engineering council describe [Civil Engineers](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC.md) as:

*Engineers and technicians respond to the needs of both society and business, solving complex challenges. Engineers and technicians work in the art and practice of changing our world, enhancing welfare, health and safety while paying due regard to the environment. *

*Society places great faith in the engineering profession, trusting its members to regulate themselves. ==By achieving and demonstrating professional competence and commitment for the purpose of registration, engineers and technicians demonstrate that they are worthy of that trust.==*
