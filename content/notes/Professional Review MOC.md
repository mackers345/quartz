# Professional Review
The Professional Review is the final stage of becoming a [Chartered Engineer (CEng)](notes/Chartered%20Engineer%20(CEng).md). As per the [ICE guidance report](https://www.ice.org.uk/download-centre/professional-review-guidance/), the following stages need to be completed prior to sitting the professional review. Note that the below attributes are for the updated 7 attributes, whereas I sat the review under 9 attributes. It is important to know how The [Engineering Council (EC)](notes/Engineering%20Council%20(EC).md) contributes and is involved in the professional review system.

As individuals, and engineers, we must be continuously completing a process of self-reflection (similar to that presented in [ISO 9001 2015](notes/ISO%209001%202015.md)'s [Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle (PDCA)](notes/Plan-Do-Check-Act%20Cycle%20(PDCA).md):

1) assess yourself against the end-product
2) identify any deficiencies
3) seek experience or off-the-job training
4) rectify any shortcomings
