# Process Approach

This is a requirement within [ISO 9001 2015](notes/ISO%209001%202015.md), and is defined as:

> *Process approach - General.* An organisation is composed of linked activities - processes that transform inputs to outputs. The requirements of [ISO 9001 2015](notes/ISO%209001%202015.md) are organised as processes, with explicit connections from one process to the next.

Within [ISO 9001 2015](notes/ISO%209001%202015.md), the process structure fits into two levels:

## 1. Whole organisation
The whole organisation can be displayed in the form of a [Process Map](notes/Process%20Map.md), which provides a complete overview of the organisation and its core processes.

## 2. Individual processes
These can be displayed in flow-charts, turtle diagrams or other diagrams. This aims to break down the different production chains, identifying inputs and outputs, and the other steps along the way.
