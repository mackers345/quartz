# Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle (PDCA)
In order to satisfy the [Process Approach](notes/Process%20Approach.md) displayed in [ISO 9001 2015](notes/ISO%209001%202015.md), it is important for organisations to adopt, and auditors to see, a process control loop of incoming customer requirements (input), and the determined customer satisfaction (indirect output). The plan-do-check-act cycle is a general framework for ensuring this is carried out.
