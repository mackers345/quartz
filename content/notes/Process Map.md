As defined in the Galliford Try [Quality Management Manual](attachments/PO-QAM-100%20Quality%20Management%20Manual.pdf):

> “Process Maps”. These explain the entire business. They tell you what certain groups of people need to do, what information they need to do it, and the outputs that are expected of them. They also show where cross department communication is needed. Process Maps are important tools to enable users of the system to familiarize themselves with inputs, outputs, procedures and guidance available within the BMS.
